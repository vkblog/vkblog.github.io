This Saturday, when the weather decided to become more clement (see chart of weather clement-ness below,) Mr. B and I went horseback riding in Virginia.  My friend Christina is an avid rider and in the process of purchasing a horse, and she wanted to go see it this weekend, so I asked if we could tag along.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2123" title="Weather" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/01/Weather.png" alt="" width="492" height="436" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/01/Weather.png)

We&#8217;d been riding before, once in the Golan Heights at [Vered HaGalil](http://www.veredhagalil.com/) and once in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and we liked it a lot, so we were really excited to go to [JAS Stables](http://www.jasstables.com/JAS_Stables/Home.html) where we actually got to learn how to brush horses and do horse-related things like try to feed them candy which they love, unless apparently they are being fed by one of us.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2133" title="Picture 3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/01/Picture-3.png" alt="" width="664" height="501" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/01/Picture-3.png)

However, for some reason, I had a sense of foreboding that would, I thought, lead to imminent death, mostly because I was afraid I&#8217;d end up like Christopher Reeve.

Even though Jon, one of the owners of the stables, is awesome and extremely safety-conscious, I am always paranoid in that I, like [Shalom Auslander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom_Auslander), think God is trying to kill me just when I am happy and mostly unawares.  This is why I never go to weddings where there is lots of alcohol.  Based on this fact, Mr. B and I had the following 20-minute conversation before AND after we went:

**Me:** What if I fall off a horse and become paralyzed from the waist down, like Christopher Reeve?
  
**Mr. B:** You won&#8217;t.  \*turns on the Tennis Channel\*
  
**Me:** But what if I do and then you have to feed me through a spoon for sixty-plus years until I give in and beg you for a swift and merciful death?
  
**Mr. B:** \*not hearing me because he is busy watching Nadal v. Federer on a hard surface\*
  
**Me:** Well??
  
**Mr. B:** What? \*turns away from his man crush\*
  
**Me:** What if I fall off a horse and become a parapalegic?
  
**Mr. B:** I&#8217;m pretty sure Christopher Reeve was drunk when he fell off his horse.  It&#8217;s a little-known fact.
  
**Me:** I don&#8217;t think so.  I think he was sober and so am I.
  
**Mr. B:** \*back in tennis land\*
  
**Me:** \*muttering under breath\* I hope you like pushing wheelchairs.

What was most amazing in the two hours that we spent there is how quickly you get used to being on a horse  and start getting a feel for how it works.  Of course, my horse, Hoover, sucked.  Well, not that he sucked, but mostly I sucked because he&#8217;s a show horse and I couldn&#8217;t cue him the right way, so he would stop and start like a 1986 Chevy that hasn&#8217;t had a state inspection in a decade.  But after a while I started feeling a lot better about it and even broke into a slight (terrifying) trot.

Trotting is insanely hard if you&#8217;ve never done it before because you can&#8217;t just sit on the horse-you have to find the rhythm and balance that will allow you to absorb the shock.  It&#8217;s the same if you&#8217;re walking, as well.  You have to move your hips and torso and keep your body upright with the up and down paces of the horse.  It&#8217;s pretty tricky.

And as I was holding on for dear life and bracing myself for a fall on my spinal cord, I started to get the hang of it.  If  I just made sure to feel Hoover&#8217;s movements and adjust to them, I could get into a kind of steady rhythm.  He trusted me, and I trusted him.

And, in a way, that&#8217;s how I think blogging is, too.  You don&#8217;t always have the rhythm.  Sometimes you&#8217;re on, sometimes you&#8217;re off.  Sometimes I write posts that are too politically and [economically heavy](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/01/25/predictions-on-the-economy-from-a-dismal-scientist/) but that are important for me to write, sometimes I write [really silly posts](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/02/06/the-most-depressing-baby-songs-ever-russian-ones/) that are equally part of the fun for blogging for me.  It&#8217;s always difficult for me to keep a balance between personal and professional on the blog, but I keep trying.   You keep writing and soon enough, you&#8217;ll find your balance and rhythm.  Hopefully, after a year of blogging,  I&#8217;m on my way to finding mine.
