If it&#8217;s one thing the Soviets were good at, it was celebrating [International Women&#8217;s Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women%27s_Day), which is on March 8th every year.  Unlike Mother&#8217;s Day in Western Europe and America, March 8th is a celebration of all women regardless of whether they are mothers, and of their contribution to society.  Here&#8217;s a cool piece Mr. B and I heard today about [the contribution of women to America&#8217;s space program](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10125596) in the 1960s.  And here&#8217;s a story about the [first Russian woman in space](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7826462). Here is [one of my favorite Soviet posters](http://www.rusk.ru/images/2007/5392.jpg) for March 8.

Here are some previous posts I wrote on all things women:
