So we have some Jewish holidays coming up. More specifically, the New Year.  Inspired by [this post](http://www.frumsatire.net/2010/09/07/before-rosh-hashanah-i-hope-you-will-forgive-me/), I am listing all my wrongs from the past year in hopes that the internets will forgive me.

  * I have watched Jersey Shore, on more than one occasion, and have rejoiced when Ronnie cheats on Sammi, who is too stupid to break up with him.
  * I have pushed past tourists on the D.C. escalators who stand on the left-hand side when everyone KNOWS you are supposed to walk on that side.  It&#8217;s not a May Day fair, people. Some of us have to get to work. That includes you, [poorly-dressed tourist man](http://www.suburbansweetheart.com/2010/08/stuff-tourists-like-part-iv.html).
  * I have eaten chocolate malted milk balls from the &#8220;in bulk&#8221; section at the grocery store when no one was looking.  But only two at a time, I swear to God.
  * I have woken Mr. B up before 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday. More than once.
  * I have gossiped.  Oh, how I have gossiped.
  * I have said, publicly, that the worst part of working with Jewish organizations is the Jews.
  * I have eaten horrible, horrible, delicious things in mass quantities.
  * I have [stalked innocent author Gary Shteyngart](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/07/28/gary-shteyngart-kind-of-acknowledges-me-on-facebook/) through his Facebook page.

  * I have been](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/01/31/millions-of-babies-the-holocaust-and-gender-segregation-its-the-weekend/) and compared it to the Holocaust.
  * I have [purchased &#8220;food&#8221; from McDonald&#8217;s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Food_Nation) and eaten it in the car, then chewed 5 pieces of gum so Mr. B wouldn&#8217;t know.
  * I have defended [Mizrachi music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_music).
  * I have yelled at motorists who annoy me with a selection of words in Hebrew, English, and Russian.
  * I have written a blog filled with horrible, horrible things, which other people actually read.

Happy New Year.
