I am in Israel! But the links are still here.  And they are sad. Hey, links, you should have booked your ticket on El Al, too.

1.  [Russian Jews ponder the age-old question: America or Israel.](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1108589.html) Unfortunately a question too close to my heart.  ([Thanks, Sarah](http://the-word-well.com/)!)
  
2.  [Hillary Clinton&#8217;s relevant again](http://jezebel.com/5341077/hillary-clinton-tackles-economics-terrorism-microlending-in-ny-times-profile?skyline=true&s=x).  Or something.
  
3.  [Locks of love in Russia](http://englishrussia.com/?p=4857) (real locks, not hair.)
  
4.  [Jewish classics set to Latin beats](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112122180).  This is so cool.
  
5.  Orchids: [the whores of the flower world](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112124695).
  
6.  [Milena is right](http://www.quietthethunder.com/2009/08/rationing-happens.html), as usual.
  
7. Want to learn Arabic?  [All roads point to Damashq](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8211446.stm). (Damascus)
  
8. [What your tattoo location says about you](http://current.com/items/90199795_what-your-tattoo-locations-say-about-you.htm) (thanks, [Negev Rock City](http://negevrockcity.com/)!)
  
9.  [As he was greeting them](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3765634,00.html), he was eating shwarma and licking his lips.
  
10.  [Progress](http://www.jewlicious.com/2009/08/meet-washingtons-gay-friendly-orthodox-rabbi/)!
