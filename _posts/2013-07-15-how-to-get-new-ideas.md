  1. Stop reading Facebook so often. It will <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2013/03/the-banality-of-evil-on-facebook/" target="_blank">make you miserable</a>. And overly concerned with what other people are doing.  <a href="http://actualfacebookgraphsearches.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">And tracked. </a>
  2. Stop watching the same TV sitcoms everyone else is watching. Watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821480/" target="_blank">really good foreign films</a>.  Watch movies from the dollar bin at WalMart. Watch <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/documentaries/" target="_blank">free documentaries</a>. Watch movies as they are meant to be watched; <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/" target="_blank">in their original language</a>.
  3. Don&#8217;t read airport books. Go to tiny bookstores and buy zines. Buy old National Geographics. Buy 70s textbooks. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Highland-Regiment-Mesopotamia-1916-1917-ebook/dp/B0082QWRBO/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1373938788&sr=1-5&keywords=mesopotamia+free" target="_blank">Buy stuff no one has rated on Amazon</a>. Read random non-fiction books about birds from the library.
  4. Study <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/improvisation" target="_blank">weird things</a> that have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of your life.
  5. Stop listening to pop radio. Listen to <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/fado" target="_blank">fado</a>. Unless you are Portuguese. Then l<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfXg3lJQGwk" target="_blank">isten to this song about how some dude is really proud to be Bosnian</a>.
  6. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania" target="_blank">Go to strange places</a> that are not meant to be for tourist consumption.
  7. Don&#8217;t retweet and reblog things that have already gone viral and ride the wave of popularity. Look for something tiny and beautiful that you alone are interested in. Share that link with one other person who understands how weird and creepy you are.
  8. Put yourself in u<a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2013/05/i-am-calling-bullshit-on-italian-breakfast/" target="_blank">ncomfortable situations</a>.
  9. Be weird and creepy like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AkCcPDHLHA" target="_blank">platypus. </a>
 10. Don&#8217;t listen to other people who think they know you and make lists telling you what to do.
