Two quick things over at my other sites:  For Walrus, [I reported on Kanat Saudabayev](http://walrus.vickiboykis.com/2010/02/08/kanat-saudabayev-speaks-at-atlantic-council/), Kazakhstan&#8217;s Secretary of State, at the Atlantic Council in DC.  It was really exciting, [especially in light of the Kazakh movie](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/12/17/movie-review-gift-to-stalin-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%83-and-interview-with-cast/) I saw recently:

And, regarding the Blizzard of the Century, [I went clinically insane](http://gallery.vickiboykis.com/2010/02/07/fake-movie-poster-snowmageddon/).

Because, really, how many jigsaw puzzles can you put together in a day?  Also, don&#8217;t make fun of my cat hat.  I requested it to be made by my mom in 10th grade and you know what?  It&#8217;s amazing.
