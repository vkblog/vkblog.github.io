So, I&#8217;m in the middle of sketching out my main character for the  [enormously satirical novel I&#8217;m going to write next month](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/10/11/my-unborn-novel-is-annoying-me-nanowrimo/), when I realize I have no idea how to be funny.  So I looked up some advice on writing satire from the pros.

Here&#8217;s what [Lewis Carroll](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll) had to say:

Why dost thou call, oh wicked muse?
  
Why do you trumple through my brain?
  
Oh, how you squartle through my mind
  
Wherefore, you render me insane.

To pen a funny, start with John.
  
John is a carpenter in Leeds.
  
He pounds and saws and hems and haws,
  
And, oh how trumbulent his deeds!

And then, in wanders tiny Jane.
  
John loves her with a glurgling heart.
  
He wants her so, he daren&#8217;t let her go;
  
Observes her nightly, for a start.

There&#8217;s John, there&#8217;s Jane, and all is well.
  
You have a novel here, you see.
  
But all is bland and too well-planned-
  
And then-John plummets from a tree.

And suddenly, your well-paced tome,
  
Where plot would boringly expire;
  
Now has a trick-oh, how, and quick!
  
Your boilerplate is now satire!

Oh, slurby John, what have you done?
  
When you corrumpled from that oak?
  
To make it fair, I left you there.
  
Just when I thought you were to croak.

But, sentiments all flung aside,
  
Oh, snarkly reader, you enthrall.
  
The reason John is satire now?
  
The blasted oak was two feet tall.
