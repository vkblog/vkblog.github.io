Me: \*conducting book research\*
  
Me: Jesus. Lermontov was only 26 when he died? Jesus.  What a moron.
  
Mr. B: ?
  
Me: Well he died by duel, right?  Who does that to themselves?
  
Mr. B: You can&#8217;t equate yesterday&#8217;s standards with today.
  
Me: Yes you can.  It&#8217;s like \*reaching for an analogy\* huffing paint.
  
Mr. B: Yes, it&#8217;s exactly like that. I&#8217;m sure Lermontov today would be like, &#8220;Yeah, I think I&#8217;ll huff some paint and kill myself.&#8221;
  
Me: So you&#8217;re saying that you would never defend my honor by duel?
  
Mr. B: What?
  
Me: If we lived back in the day and someone insulted me, you wouldn&#8217;t duel them?
  
Mr. B: Well it depends. What are we talking about here?  Like if someone steps on your toe? Or, like, physically assaults you?
  
Me: It doesn&#8217;t matter. Honor&#8217;s honor.
  
Mr. B: It kind of does if I&#8217;m risking my life.
  
Me: You wouldn&#8217;t do well in the 17th century.
  
Mr. B: Actually I think I would because I wouldn&#8217;t be  dueling all the time.
