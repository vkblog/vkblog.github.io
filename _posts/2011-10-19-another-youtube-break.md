Paraphrased:

&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to study/
  
I only want to get married/
  
I&#8217;d rather ride around in a bangin&#8217; car around the capital at night
  
Rather than other stuff.

Life is stressful,
  
Why does she need all these cares?
  
Studying, thesis, work,
  
She already has enough problems,
  
Shopping, manicures, and moisturizer.&#8221;

And on and on in this vein.

&nbsp;

I played this song for Mr. B  and he got a panicked look on his face because he though he would have to go through a wedding again.

&#8220;No, it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t want to study or work.  I just want to buy moisturizer <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/07/12/this-post-about-how-i-guilt-buy-febreeze-on-amazon-is-going-to-be-a-goldmine-for-marketers/" target="_blank">on Amazon</a>.&#8221;
  
&#8220;So you&#8217;re not going to do anything, but we don&#8217;t have to have a wedding again?&#8221;
  
&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s cool then.&#8221;

Instant de-stresser:



How did this man live in the Soviet Union and still create such joyful, life-affirming music?



Remember this one?

Some things deserve to be remixed.



The following is not a comment on my mental state right now.
