I&#8217;ve been asked [courteously](http://twitter.com/neo_indian/status/2119728630) by [Neo Indian](http://neoindian.org/) to &#8220;give a shout out&#8221; to the [desis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desi). So, here is my story of how I grew to love Indian and South Asian culture.

It&#8217;s no secret to anyone who knows me that [I love all things Indian](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/?p=287).  I love [saris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari), [chapatis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapati), [rotis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roti), and [Saif Ali Khans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saif_Ali_Khan).   I can&#8217;t say for sure when this began, but I think it was around the time I saw [DDLJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilwale_Dulhaniya_Le_Jayenge) on tv.  As I paused to look at the father forbidding his daughter to marry someone who was of the same skin color, the same religion, and spoke the same language, I thought, how awesome.  Here is a culture that is crazier than Russians and Jews combined! Also, they dance.  A lot.   I didn&#8217;t know at that time that DDLJ was the classical hit Bollywood movie.

I especially loved this song:
  


I loved this movie so much that I began to wonder if there was some place I could get the songs.  Since I didn&#8217;t remember the name of the movie at the time, I couldn&#8217;t download them (LEGALLY, OF COURSE).  But, when I was studying International Relations for the summer of my junior year of high school at the University of Pittsburgh, I found a little Indian store near the University.

I went in.  I had no idea what anything was, only that everything smelled good.  Also, that the storekeeper was looking at me curiously.  I saw the racks of CDs and somehow located the disc.  I don&#8217;t think the storekeeper was ever more surprised than when I bought it.  I went back to my dorm and listened to it five times.

Then, I had a chance to see [Lagaan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagaan), on the same channel I caught DDLJ, IFC.  IFC was a godsend in a time when I was growing up in one of the most culturally isolated areas on the Western hemisphere, the suburbs of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where a Neato Burrito provides the local international flavor.

Lagaan is, to this day, one of my favorite Bollywood movies, mostly due to the historical slant.
  


I watched the scene repetitively. I even tried to make my then-boyfriend act it out. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you pretend like you&#8217;re jumping off a cattle cart and hug me from behind?&#8221; He looked at me like I was crazy. I bet he is glad I married Mr. B. Mr. B has to put up with a lot of crazy in the household.

That&#8217;s when I started actively seeking out my fix, both by watching Bollywood and by reading about India and Indian culture.

And then I found this:



And this, which was near and dear to my heart.  Because it was like a lot of Russian dinner parties I&#8217;ve been to.



And this.  I cried like a beluga the first time I watched this clip because it so closely touched on my close connections with Russia and Israel and the love for your home country even though there may be a lot of things broken there. Also because I wanted [SRK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahrukh_Khan)&#8216;s Ikea furniture.



And then this.  Which became one of my favorite songs, from one of my favorite movies, Parineeta.  I can&#8217;t explain why I love it so much, because if you watch it, it&#8217;s like any other Bollywood movie. But it really struck a chord in me for some reason. I made my mom and Mr. B watch it with me. Poor Mr. B.



Have you ever had a movie that completely altered the way you thought about something, or opened a new world to you?  That&#8217;s how DDJL was for me.  Bollywood opened a whole new world to me because it was just so different from how I had grown up, seemed so exotic, and yet, I felt I could really identify with Indian norms and mores because a lot of the strict conservative-type culture is close to what Russians grow up experiencing.

Question for you: Do you have any Bollywood recommendations? Or an Indian wedding they would like me to attend?  Or any movie that impacted the way you watched movies or thought? Oh, and don&#8217;t say Dhoom.  That movie was crap on a motorcycle.
