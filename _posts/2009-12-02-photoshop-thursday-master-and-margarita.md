I&#8217;ve been doing a little bit of learning of Photoshop lately because I find that it relaxes me after work and it&#8217;s always a valuable skill to learn.   So, today, I decided to make a conceptual cover for [The Master and Margarita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita), one of my favorite books as practice. What say you? Are there any books that you particularly enjoy that you&#8217;d love to see a different cover for?  Here&#8217;s some [really cool book covers](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/04/14/excellent-book-covers-and-paperbacks/) I&#8217;ve been looking at.
