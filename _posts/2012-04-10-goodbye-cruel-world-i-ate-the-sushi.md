I know no one cares about what you had for lunch. That&#8217;s the fundamental rule of sharing online.  But I need to tell you that I just had sushi, so I&#8217;m going to die.

I was halfway through a spicy tuna roll when my coworker turned to me and said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you not to buy sushi last week?&#8221;

And he was right. Because, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS446US446&ix=seb&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=sushi+salmonella#q=sushi+salmonella&hl=en&rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS446US446&prmd=imvnsu&source=univ&tbm=nws&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=VWGET8ffJ6Sr0AHHnsXaBw&ved=0CDoQqAIoADAA&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=32616ddf09bcc4cc&biw=1152&bih=526&ix=seb" target="_blank">you know how sushi has salmonella now</a>? And what&#8217;s the main culprit of salmonella?  Why, spicy tuna rolls, of course!

I stopped mid-sushi.  Finish the roll and don&#8217;t go hungry, or throw it away?

I ate the rest of the sushi.  Because I am a statistician, and I know I have like a .0001% chance of actually getting salmonella. But mostly because  I am cheap and Jewish and lazy and I didn&#8217;t want to go buy a second lunch.

And now my head is feeling a little bit faint, but I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s salmonella or my hypochondria and Jewish paranoia flaring up again?

Stay tuna-d!

HA! TUNA-D.

Oh God, I&#8217;m going to get salmonella.
