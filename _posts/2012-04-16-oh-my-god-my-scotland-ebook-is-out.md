    In my house, I have two rooms, the living room and the kitchen.  When we bought the house, I anticipated that we&#8217;d want to sell it in some time.  So, we painted the living room a  subdued beige color, so as to not startle potential buyers on first impression.  It looks really nice and comfortable. When people come, they compliment us on it. But it&#8217;s boring. Dull, dull, dull.  It looks like everyone else&#8217;s living room.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    The second room is the kitchen.  I&#8217;ve always dreamed of having an orange kitchen. This was non-negotiable.  Everyone told us not to paint the kitchen orange.  Even if they didn&#8217;t say anything, they thought it was weird as hell to have a bright orange kitchen.  But, even though it was very hard for me to do, I ignored them and painted the kitchen orange. It looks great. It&#8217;s my favorite room in the house. It reflects who I am, and it looks great with almost any other color: black, white, turquoise.

    You get where I&#8217;m going with this.  The blog is my living room.  No matter how weird  and quirky it seems, I still have to keep it nice and tidy because my first and last name are on it.

    <a href="http://ebook.vickiboykis.com">This book</a> is the kitchen.  Well, it&#8217;s not entirely the kitchen.  But it&#8217;s as close as I could come in a debut work. This book is hundreds of hours of work late at night after work and class, writing, grinding my teeth, sometimes crying, sometimes laughing hysterically at the mountain of work ahead of me.  It&#8217;s me reading passages to Mr. B hundreds of times for clarity, it&#8217;s me cutting thousands of words, thinking of the right phrase.
  </p>

    This book is twenty years in the making. Since I declared when I was five that I wanted to write my autobiography, I knew this day would somehow come.  I just never thought this is the book I&#8217;d end up writing, and I never in my wildest dreams thought I&#8217;d be able to self-publish. This book is all of my hopes, fears, and dreams.  This book is my labor of love.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I loved writing it, and that, no matter your opinion of the book, you leave a review on Amazon, or in the comments here.  I&#8217;m dying to know what you think.  I happen to think it&#8217;s not too bad, but I&#8217;m biased.

    Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote that a person who publishes a book appears willfully in public eye with his pants down. Well, my pants are down, and I am terrified.
