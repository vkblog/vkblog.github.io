I&#8217;ve [written before](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/02/15/bye-bye-jezebel/) [how I miss](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/04/27/open-thread-what-do-you-eat-in-your-media-diet/) the Old Jezebel and Good Content for Women. The Hairpin, one of my new faves, [alerted me to the new ladysite](http://thehairpin.com/2011/05/welcome-xojane-com) opened by Jane Pratt, formerly of Jane, which I loved growing up, and Sassy, which everyone else loved but I missed.

When you first hear about [XOJane](http://www.xojane.com/), you&#8217;re filled with hope, because [Jane was awesome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_(magazine)) and spoke in a tone different from Glamour, Cosmo, etc, and covered real-people issues, none of which I can remember at the moment, but which really did resonate at the time. Â Then, you come to the site and see this:
