This year, [as last year](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/07/28/are-you-fasting-on-thursday/) and at least three years before that, I&#8217;m fasting for Tisha B&#8217;Av because I consider it more of a national Jewish holiday than a religious fast like Yom Kipur, and I think it&#8217;s a shame that more secular Jews don&#8217;t participate in a day completely devoted to feeling depressed about the state of our people.  (When I tried guilting Mr. B into fasting this year, he said he would &#8220;try to eat less.&#8221;)

IThe more I go along, the more I realize just how orthoprax I am: believing in the necessity of Jewish rituals to build community, without necessarily believing in the existence of a God that would enjoy my [brain aneurism](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/09/16/gods-is-straight-up-messing-with-me/).

As usual, I&#8217;m skipping all the religious traditions that go with Tisha B&#8217;Av and traditional Jewish mourning rituals, such as [listening to Eicha](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Tisha_BAv/Rituals_and_Practices/Eicha_Lamentations_.shtml), sitting on low stools, and abstaining from work, but I am fasting (or at least trying to until I pass out head-first in a bowl of shrimp primavera,) which leads me to this list I made last year of foods I was craving at 11 am that day:

  * _Auntie Anne&#8217;s pretzels covered with chocolate soft serve_
  * _Penne with tomato vodka sauce and bacon salt_ (why did I write this? I don&#8217;t even like bacon)
  * _Mango-strawberry smoothie with Oreos_
  * _Cedar-plank salmon with a side of chocolate chips_
  * _Falafel with a filling of olives and French fries_
  * _Grilled cheese panini with [kale chips](http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/baked-kale-chips/Detail.aspx)_
  * _Chicken [shashlik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashlik) the way my dad makes it_

I&#8217;m off to eat all of those things before I fast.  [Tzom kal](http://www.proz.com/kudoz/english_to_hebrew/other/771735-easy_fast.html)! And [beteavon](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/cumgranosalis/archive/2006/05/16/598698.aspx) to me.
