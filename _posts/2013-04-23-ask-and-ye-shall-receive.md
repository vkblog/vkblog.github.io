In <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2012/01/my-mba-paying-thousands-of-dollars-to-mess-around-with-photoshop/" target="_blank">my MBA program</a>, there are a couple of places to take night classes, but the one that&#8217;s most convenient for me is downtown, because it&#8217;s right next to work. Unfortunately, the entrance to Suburban Station, the train station right next to the school that I use to get home,  starts to unravel quickly at night. I mean, <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2012/02/why-is-philadelphia-so-disgusting/" target="_blank">it&#8217;s already pretty gross during the day</a>, but nighttime <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2012-01-30/news/31005955_1_homeless-people-concourse-mental-illness" target="_blank">brings a special glow</a>.  So, I always think about how  dirty the area surrounding Temple downtown is, and why they can&#8217;t use their pull with the city to help fix it.

Conveniently, from time to time, <a href="http://www.fox.temple.edu/" target="_blank">my school</a> sends us surveys to fill out about the quality of our experience, both in the classroom and in the facilities so that we can complain as much as possible.

I&#8217;ve always learned both at work and in school that you should never just  come to someone with a problem; you should also have at least a couple possible ways to solve it.  But, this is just for my MBA and everyone knows part-time MBA students are pretty tired and already 100% invested in classes, and also I have NO IDEA how to navigate the sprawling City of Philadelphia political system.

So, here you go, Temple.
