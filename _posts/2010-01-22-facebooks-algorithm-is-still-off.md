So, Facebook&#8217;s algorithm [must be still off](http://www.tomsguide.com/us/Facebook-reconnect-dead-users,news-4968.html) because it&#8217;s asking me to reconnect with some random guy that I only know BECAUSE I&#8217;M MARRIED TO HIM.  I wonder what I should write on this guy&#8217;s wall?  We haven&#8217;t talked for so long?  Probably not since last night before I went to bed.

On another note, did you know [Facebook stole your soul](http://therumpus.net/2010/01/conversations-about-the-internet-5-anonymous-facebook-employee/?full=yes&utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter)?

Happy Friday!
