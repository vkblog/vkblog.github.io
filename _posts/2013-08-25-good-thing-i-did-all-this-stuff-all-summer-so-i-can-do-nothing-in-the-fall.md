<a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2013/05/summer-is-looking-too-ambitious/" target="_blank">Early on in the summer</a>, I wrote that I had a bunch of goals I wanted to accomplish.  Now that summer&#8217;s done, how did I do?

<!--more-->

Basically, it&#8217;s really easy to do stuff when I don&#8217;t have classes after work.

The way I focused on these goals was one main goal a month and the rest as side-goals. So in June, Python was my main goal. In July, it was my novel, and in August, it was the fitness/weight loss. In September, I basically plan to sit on the couch in my sweatpants and refresh Buzzfeed every five minutes.

**Lose 10 pounds and run 1 5k: ** Lost 7. Still working on the other 3. It&#8217;s really hard to keep losing weight when you&#8217;re surrounded by awesome Philly restaurants. This summer, we&#8217;ve been to <a href="http://www.morimotorestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Morimoto</a>, <a href="http://www.whitedog.com/" target="_blank">White Dog Cafe</a>, <a href="http://cubalibrerestaurant.com/i/philadelphia/" target="_blank">Cuba Libre</a>, <a href="http://vernickphilly.com/" target="_blank">Vernick</a>, <a href="http://hungrybearcafes.com/cafe/" target="_blank">Hungry Bear Cafe</a>, <a href="http://animojuice.com/" target="_blank">Animo</a>, <a href="http://www.barferdinand.com/" target="_blank">Bar Ferdinand</a>, <a href="http://www.audreyclaire.com/" target="_blank">Audrey Claire</a>, <a href="http://justhookedfi.com/" target="_blank">Just Hooked,</a> and <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2013/08/on-the-amalfi-coast/" target="_blank">Italy</a>. All come highly recommended.

I ran 5k  this weekend, actually. It wasn&#8217;t an official race, but I ran the 5k on my own. I&#8217;ve been working up to it all summer since I took some time off running this winter to familiarize myself with frozen desserts.  And yes, I&#8217;m really slow.

I did a lot of sunrise runs. They were great.

**Rewrite main website code in Bootstrap.** <a href="http://vickiboykis.com/" target="_blank">Done!</a> This was the easiest one. It took me about two nights to crank out. Bootstrap is a really cool framework, or set of HTML/CSS style files that is really good for static (read: not often updated like blogs) sites, and I recommend you check it out if you want stuff to look slick.

**Learn Python:** Kind of. I definitely am using at least three programs that I wrote at work right now and I started a <a href="https://github.com/veekaybee/" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> and [blog](http://wtfbigdata.vickiboykis.com/) to document my programming learnings, although they&#8217;re pretty sparse for now.  I&#8217;m hoping to get them up to speed in the fall.  I&#8217;m also going to keep learning Python. I also took a class <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-Philadelphia/events/125147652/" target="_blank">taught in Python</a> to brush up my skills.

**Finish second draft of novel:** Mneh. No, but I&#8217;ve been chipping away at it. I finished the first draft, and started three more drafts before I finally started writing the one that&#8217;s going to be close to the end-novel. So I wrote about 20,000 words in vain, and am now 12,000 words into the actual rewrite of the novel. I&#8217;ve also been doing tons of research reading:

Conveniently, programming and writing go together&#8230;if you&#8217;re not doing one, you can procrastinate by doing the other. I wrote a program to do a wordcount of my text file:

[<img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9042" alt="1010408_10104833092381014_930579791_n" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/08/1010408_10104833092381014_930579791_n-580x161.jpg" width="580" height="161" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/08/1010408_10104833092381014_930579791_n.jpg)

When I wasn&#8217;t doing any of that, I was busy trying to cram as much real summer into my summer as I could. My mom got us tickets to Wicked for my birthday, so we saw that. We went to the beach. We ate a lot of watermelon. I painted.  We celebrated tons of birthdays.

All in all, life was good, which is why I was away from the blog.

Now I&#8217;m back, refreshed, and ready to complain in 500-700 word posts three times a week once again.
