>   Though Indian women in America are encouraged to enter male-dominated fields like engineering and medicine our path to success is still difficult. <strong>We are expected to maintain the household, cook traditional meals, and have a career. </strong>Our mothers warn us against fraternizing with boys, especially non-Indian males. Accusing Haley of affairs with other men must her family deeply and is the lowest possible blow to her reputation.
