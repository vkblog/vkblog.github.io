So, this week I&#8217;ve been pretty busy with my new job, grad school orientation, surviving earthquakes, and devouring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magician-King-Novel-Lev-Grossman/dp/0670022314" target="_blank">The Magician King</a> (more on that next week).  And this weekend I&#8217;m ready to fight for my life.  So you can imagine I don&#8217;t have too many links this go around.
