Mr. B and I are stressed out right now, for [a multitude](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/03/23/a-russian-fairy-tale-tori-and-the-firebird/) of [reasons](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/03/15/whoever-said-life-is-about-adventure-and-risk-taking-never-had-typhoid-shots/).   The amount of decisions we&#8217;ve had to make recently are overwhelming us and they&#8217;re something I&#8217;ve thought about every day, for at least the past six months.  When we&#8217;re done, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll feel 10 lbs lighter.

Yesterday, my parents came to visit us and we took them to see  cherry blossoms.  Not the ones in the Tidal Basin, because that&#8217;s where all the tourists cause congested arteries, but [[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2707" title="DSC03083" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/04/DSC03083.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="428" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/04/DSC03083.jpg)

There&#8217;s something about cherry blossoms that, when you see them, you relax.

Because, when it&#8217;s sunny and cherry blossom petals are falling all around you, the world can&#8217;t be all that bad.

&#8220;It&#8217;s like snow,&#8221;  my mom said. And it was.
