As I was working on a new post today about Gabby Sidibe and whether her being overweight had implications for the entertainment industry and its images of women, I decided, um, what???!!! LOL! Who rlly cares?? I just want to rite about shoes!

Why do I always blog about boring shyte like [economics](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/01/27/my-b-s-in-economics-is-no-match-for-fist-pumping/), [women](https://vkblog.github.io/2009/07/12/bride-kidnapping-in-kyrgyzstan/), [and how much I love Nutella](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/02/19/nutellaaaaaaa/).  I re-read those blogs again and fell asleep!!!!  Who would want to read about that??? hahahah.   And who really cares about [Russia](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/03/21/what-do-rich-russians-and-egg-incubation-have-to-do-with-my-weekend-everything/)? Or [Israel](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/01/28/this-tu-bshvat-im-buying-a-donkey-and-a-plane-ticket-to-haifa/)?  God, I was such a freak!

So basically, chicas, all shoes all the time now!  <img src="https://vkblog.github.io/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://vkblog.github.io/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />Oh and baby bumps and celebrity gossip. Cause that&#8217;s how my favorite site, PopSugar, does it!

Here&#8217;s the pair I bought last nite.  Hubby said that we couldn&#8217;t afford them unless we decided to skip buying a house but I was all like, &#8220;Omg!  These are so in style this season and I just seriously need them.  You don&#8217;t know anything about shoes.&#8221;  So I bought them!! There Loboutins!!  Duh.  I don&#8217;t buy any other kind of shoes.   Did you think I was weird or somethin??
