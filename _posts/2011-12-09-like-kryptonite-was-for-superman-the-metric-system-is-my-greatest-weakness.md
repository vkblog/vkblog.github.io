So, Mr. B and I are going on a vacation.  Sometime soon. Maybe we&#8217;re even on vacation as we speak.  But maybe we&#8217;re at our house and if you try to rob it I&#8217;ll karate-kick you. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mwOPCl_0sU" target="_blank">Surprise</a>!

We are or will be, or were in Europe. You guys know by now that I am a connoisseur of culture and love everything international I&#8217;ve done everything from <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/09/14/indian-classical-dance-bharatan-what/" target="_blank">Indian Classical Dance</a> to the <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/01/19/mrs-bej-and-bellydancing-after-the-saudi-arabian-embassy/" target="_blank">Saudi Arabian embassy </a>to <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/11/30/dr-maia-singh-and-the-indian-jews-of-israel/" target="_blank">the Cochin Jews</a> to <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/06/29/i-almost-died-for-a-250-discount-on-an-ikea-chair/" target="_blank">West Philly</a>. I got like 5 shots in preparation to go to India, and I have eaten squid. I also admire <a href="http://xkcd.com/54/" target="_blank"> Science</a>.

But.

I have realized I am a very proud ignorant American.

Why?

Because this makes absolutely no sense to me:

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-08-at-10.17.34-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6006" title="Screen shot 2011-12-08 at 10.17.34 PM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/12/Screen-shot-2011-12-08-at-10.17.34-PM.png" alt="" width="513" height="308" /></a>I physically cannot convert metric to American in my mind.  Thanks to the American school system, I&#8217;ve encountered my own personal Waterloo.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I keep imagining these scenarios where Mr. B is taken hostage and to rescue him I have to be able to understand Metric details.  So some Eurotrash guy with a Liam  Neeson accent will call me and will be like, &#8220;We have your husband, V.  You can give us the ransom money. Meet us on a day outside of Bruges when the temperature is 10 degrees Celsius, 500 meters away from the train station.  Oh, and you&#8217;re not allowed to use Google.&#8221; And they&#8217;ll hang up.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Let&#8217;s see, minus10 degrees Celsius.  If you take the 7, divide by two, multiply by 45, OHMYGOD. There is no way I, as an American (let&#8217;s conveniently ignore the fact that I&#8217;m not technically one), can be expected to understand this system.  Bye, Mr. B.  So sorry. So stupid.
</p>

The American measurement system represents freedom.  It represents apple pie.  It represents 2-ply toilet paper.  It represents a country that pisses off the rest of the free world and doesn&#8217;t care about any consequences.  This is the America I know and love.

It represents that moment when Mr. B and I landed on a late flight from Israel and, starving, we walked into a Wendy&#8217;s.  It was the most disgusting Wendy&#8217;s of my life.  The greasiest fries.  The palest chicken nuggets.  But as we were greedily scarfing down the liquid pools of fat and dousing them in honey mustard, I kid you not, the Star-Spangled Banner started playing right there in that Wendy&#8217;s at 12 o&#8217;clock in the morning, I cried. Because, God Bless America. God Bless Wendy&#8217;s. And God Bless whoever thought up measurement independence from Europe.

I am a proud member of a nation of 300 million standard morons.  (130.5 million morons metric)
