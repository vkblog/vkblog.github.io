Spring in [Northeast Philly](http://www.phillymag.com/articles/the_late_great_northeast/) has sprung. I guess I should stop taking pictures from the car, but this was at a traffic light, so no possible hipster injury risk.

  1. &#8220;[The Grand Tour has been a tradition of newly rich countries](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/18/110418fa_fact_osnos#ixzz1JQs8A100) ever since young British aristocrats took to the Continent in the eighteenth century, picking up languages, antiques, and venereal disease.&#8221;
  2. &#8220;[Poor Joey’s food truck](http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2011/04/americas_next_great_restaurant_4.html) is a graphic abomination the likes of which have not been seen since Master P’s last album cover: We have photos of despondent spaghetti on plates; a cartoon of Joey’s grandma; the Brooklyn Bridge; and more fonts than you could shake a Zapf Dingbat at. It looks like the Internet threw up on a children’s book.&#8221;
  3. I&#8217;m on [Pinterest now](http://pinterest.com/veeko/), so stop your life and look at the pretty pictures.
  4. &#8220;[We settled into coach on an Air China](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/18/110418fa_fact_osnos) non-stop flight to Frankfurt, and I opened a Chinese packet of “Outbound Group Advice,” which we’d been urged to read carefully. The specificity of the instructions suggested a history of unpleasant surprises: “Don’t travel with knockoffs of European goods, because customs inspectors will seize them and penalize you.” There was an intense focus on staying safe in Europe.&#8221;
  5. &#8220;[We recently received, in a tube sent by postal mail](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/04/14/opinion/20110414-letters-scroll.html), something new in our experience: a 15-foot-long scroll to the editor, below.&#8221;
  6. [Business casual causes confusion among morons](http://www.usatoday.com/money/workplace/2007-07-09-business-casual-attire_N.htm).
  7. &#8220;[I remember the precise moment I began a lifelong love of Kazakh food.](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/culture/comfort-me-with-horse-meat-and-vinegar/8482/) I was sitting at a dingy plastic table with some friends at a food cart in Karaganda, a rather industrial town in the center of Kazakhstan, and we were grabbing some lunch after a very long morning trying to teach idiomatic English to some college students.&#8221;
  8. [Girls and their bedrooms](http://thehairpin.com/2011/04/girls-and-their-bedrooms).
  9. [Writing a blank check](http://www.treppenwitz.com/2011/04/dividends.html) to the State of Israel.
 10. &#8220;“[We take pride in the country of Persia](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/dining/24passover.html),” said Mrs. Maddahi, who will host the first Seder on Monday night. “It was an old monarchy, with thousands of years of history.”
 11. &#8220;I am hardly alone; [almost everyone I know seems to have the KitchenAid mixers and Cuisinarts](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/05/the-joy-of-not-cooking/8442/) they got for their wedding still sitting in their boxes, to emerge at Thanksgiving, if ever.&#8221;
 12. &#8220;[I’m jealous.](http://therumpus.net/2011/03/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-69-we-are-all-savages-inside/) I’m jealous of people who succeed at what I do (write literary fiction). I’m jealous of them even if I love them or like them or respect them.&#8221;
 13. The [market for glasses](http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article04081101.aspx).
 14. [In Australia, you tip counterclockwise](http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/opinion/blogs/blunt-instrument/tipping-a-legitimate-form-of-payment-or-an-excuse-for-slavery-20110414-1dehk.html).
