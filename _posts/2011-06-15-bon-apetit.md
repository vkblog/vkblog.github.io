Thanks to <a href="http://www.lostincheeseland.com/" target="_blank">Lindsey</a>, I found out that <a href="http://www.uwishunu.com/2011/06/its-official-shake-shack-is-bringing-its-delicious-burgers-to-philadelphia-first-philly-location-of-the-famous-burger-stand-to-open-at-20th-sansom-in-2012/" target="_blank">Shake Shack is opening in Philadelphia</a>.

Matt lives in DC and taunts me almost every day with how awesome DC is and how much Philly sucks. So I told him that a Shake Shack was coming to Philly.

This is the resulting dialogue.
