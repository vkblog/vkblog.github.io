It&#8217;s a [synagogue](http://www.rodephshalom.org/)! And not just any synagogue, one of the only ones in the United States that retains a Byzantine-Moorish style and is the o[ldest synagogue in the Western Hemisphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregation_Rodeph_Shalom_(Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania)). ALSO included:

> From its founding, Rodeph Shalom was determined not to exclude members based on financial circumstances. Additionally, in 1829, a rule about intermarriage was established: “Members who married non-Jews would not be expelled as long as they raised their children as Jews.”

Must investigate. Now, to get [inside](http://www.rodephshalom.org/about/home.php)!

Maybe you won&#8217;t be subject to posts lamenting how lacking culture Philly is, after all.
