Something I think about a lot is what it takes to be a good manager, what kinds of things you should provide a manager so they can excel, and what it would take to be a good U.S. president.  I&#8217;m pretty good at managing and organizing groups of people, as Mr. B would grudgingly tell you, so the art of management and leadership is interesting to me on a <a href="http://dilbert.com/fast/1994-02-22/" target="_blank">non-buzzword bingo</a> level.

Which is why I did not watch the Republican debate last night.

Everyone who has run for President of the U.S.  over the past, I&#8217;d say, 30 years, has been ridiculously underqualified.  Not that I&#8217;m a presidential historian, but it seems to me you do not need to be a lawyer to be president.  Or even a governor.  Here are the qualifications I think a president should have (note: I say he/his, but I mean any candidate.  I just hate that bullshit his/her thing you have to do to be pc these days.)

  * Understand how an economy works. At least a B.A. in Economics, hopefully more. But what&#8217;s more important is practical experience in economics.  Being able to explain things. Not rely on aides.  Be well-read in economic history and papers.
  * Have worked at least 6  months in fast food. Or cleaning toilets. Or customer service at minimum wage.
  * Travelled extensively. Have visited at least one country in each continent.
  * Try to apply for Medicare or Medicaid benefits on his own.
  * Have to be on-hold with the IRS.
  * Have a job where his health insurance comes from.  Support his spouse on the benefits.
  * Experience the lack of maternity leave in the U.S., either from her own perspective, or via a spouse.
  * Run a small business for six months. Have it fail.  Have to declare bankruptcy.
  * Try to apply for a Driver&#8217;s license, spend time at any DMV.
  * Speak AT LEAST Spanish and French, with Mandarin as an optimistic plus
  * Enjoy reading and be well-read. Constantly be reading, not just official documents, but the fiction of today. Maybe even blog comments.
  * Be a student of history, especially Afghanistan/Central Asia, and  China
  * Understanding of technology is a MUST. If you don&#8217;t know how to use email, understand why the net should be neutral, or understand the difference between Netflix and pirating, and why everyone is using Twitter now, you&#8217;re not qualified.
  * Served in the military for at least a year.  But not more.  Enough to get an idea of what it feels like to send someone off to war and alter their entire miniverse.

  Now that I look at these, it&#8217;s no wonder that no one good has ever been elected. There&#8217;s no way a person could accumulate enough life experience to understand most of his constituents.
