  <em>Reader(s)!  Please note that sometime over the next week I will be shifting the blog over to http://blog.vickiboykis.com to make room for a front page that doesn&#8217;t make me look like a crazed Nutella lover, a fact that people will find out only on the blog. Mwuahahaha.  Not too drastic of a change, but you&#8217;ll want to update your bookmarks. RSS shouldn&#8217;t be affected *crosses fingers* Danke schoen. </em>

  Thanks to a tip from Mr. B&#8217;s cousin, I am now writing looking at the trainwreck that is <a href="http://www.jamiecalendar.com/">The Year of the Jewish Woman</a> Calendar (MOST DEFINITELY NSWF,) produced by<a href="http://reluctantla.blogspot.com/"> Jamie  Sneider</a> (whose blog is also somewhat NSWF.) Here is the<a href="http://www.jewcy.com/gallery/years_worth_jewish_ta"> full set of pictures</a> for the 2009 calendar.

        Go ahead, take a glance at the half-naked woman with the brisket. Also with a challah.  What a nice Shabbat meal.  And the, uh, body heat keeps her warm, right?

        Here&#8217;s what Sneider writes about her motivations for the calendar,
      </p>
      
      <blockquote style="text-align: left;">

          This calendar is dedicated to my Nana, Edith Sneider.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Edith managed a bakery in Miami, Florida called &#8220;Kosher Treats.&#8221; She loved kibitzing and schmoozing with the customers, and she especially loved the baked goods.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          During our family trips to Florida, each day my Papa took my sister and I to visit my Nana at her bakery. When we walked in my Nana would yell, &#8220;THESE ARE MY GRANDCHILDREN EVERYONE!&#8221; And then I&#8217;d always order the Rainbow Sprinkle cookie and my sister would get the Chinese Cookie with a dollop of chocolate.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I have fond memories of my Nana&#8217;s refrigerator full of small white bakery boxes she brought home from the bakery. When everyone was sleeping, I would open the boxes and sample the delicious pastries. I especially loved the cold chocolate-dipped, jelly finger cookies on a warm Miami night!
        </p>

              The idea for this calendar began in April 2008, when I walked into a Jewish bakery in Los Angeles. The smell of rugelach, babka and hamantashens brought me back to my childhood, and the love I had for my grandparents.<br /> This calendar is in honor of all of my grandparents: Edith and Benjamin Sneider, and Max and Bertha Shuman.

          This calendar has become so much more than an &#8216;ode to food.&#8217; It is a celebration of my identity as a Jewish woman. I wanted to express the strength, humor and sexuality that I love about a Jewish woman, and all women. It&#8217;s my ode to being alive.
        </p>

        That&#8217;s heartwarming.  I know now that the way I&#8217;ll be honoring both of my dead grandmothers (one Jewish and one not) is by wearing, alternately, hamentashen instead of real clothes, and suggestively posing naked with some spires of St. Basil&#8217;s Cathedral in strategic places.  Hey, I know feminism says you&#8217;re not supposed to judge women for how they express feminism.  And Judaism says you&#8217;re supposed to embrace whatever encourages Jewish culture amongst the youth.
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        But honestly.  I think this is an awful way of expressing both because it doesn&#8217;t offer sexy innuendo as much as it does shove sex down your throat and cheapens some of the best parts of Judaism.  I did like the Rosh HaShana picture, but, honestly, I think it would have been much more tasteful if it were at least a pregnant naked woman, who truly symbolizes rebirth, instead of an ode to vanity, which this calendar seems to be.
