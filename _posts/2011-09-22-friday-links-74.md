My mom sent me an email on Wednesday with, &#8220;Twenty years ago, we landed in New York. You were five!&#8221; and nothing else.  It made me very emotional at work. I pretended that my database was making me cry.

I thought back to when I was five, my dreams, goals and aspirations.  I wanted to be a novelist. I still want to be a novelist.   I loved ponies. Still do.  And I loved Sesame Street. Still do. Then I thought to the huge difference between then and now.  I wonder what five-year-old me would think of me.

Because Now Me is the sum of 20 years of my family&#8217;s hopes and dreams, and I hope I lived up to their expectations when they left everything behind.  Except I&#8217;m still not done living up to my own expectations. I&#8217;m not a published writer, and I still have never seen the Bay of Bengal, which is _my_ dream.  But I&#8217;m working on it.
