I spotted [I spotted](http://gambit.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/nice-view-how-about-a-game-of-chess/) in the New York Times which is timely, because I&#8217;ve been playing quite the game of chess myself lately. (Note that Kosteniuk, [who seems awesome](http://www.chessblog.com/2010/05/kosteniuk-cori-chess-match-in-machu.html), no longer lives in our Great Motherland but conveniently  resides in Florida, where she doesn&#8217;t have to worry about most of her winnings going to fund [Russia pressuring Belarus out of cakes and pies](http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2010/06/energy_blast_-_june_22_2010.htm) not to mention any and all natural resources.)

And, you know, I can relate to the pressures of playing high-profile chess games.  I&#8217;ve been playing dozens of chess games lately. Mr. B installed [a chess application](http://en.androidwiki.com/wiki/Chess_for_Android) on my Android phone when he was bored and ever since then I&#8217;ve been hooked on winning.

The only problem is that, after two weeks straight of playing at least three games a day, I have yet to win one.   This is made all the more intimidating as Mr. B, a childhood chess champion, stands over my shoulder from time to time and points out all of the wrong moves I make and then, when I offer him to take over the game, wins immediately.  And then when I call him a genius and suggest that he quit his job so that I [can manage his genius and make money off of him](http://www.chesstour.com/wo10.htm) playing chess full time like [that other Jew Weinstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Kasparov), he modestly demurs and says that he&#8217;s very rusty and can&#8217;t play very well. Do you understand why more women don&#8217;t play chess?

This is all extremely disappointing, especially since Mr. B has previously rejected my plans for him to [play tennis for fame and money](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Federer_net_worth), [create programs to steal fractions of a cent](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/quotes?qt0996772),or become a professional boxer.

The problem here is that, as a Russian, I am expected to play [excellent chess to conform to national stereotypes](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/fashion/sundaystyles/27CHESS.html).  And, apparently, [also pose nude with extremely large chess sets](http://russianwomen.wordpress.com/2010/03/18/another-beautiful-chess-grandmaster-from-belarus/) (this link is surprisingly safe for work).

However,  since I have almost zero logic skills (the kind that would make you consider a career in computer programming and, say, create programs to steal fractions of a cent over time,) I am stuck losing every single time.  So, until Mr. B gets his act together, I will be forced to continuously play the games as depicted below, in hopes that I will be in shape to play for [the big bucks](http://www.chesstour.com/wo10.htm).  Someone has to make the money in this family.
