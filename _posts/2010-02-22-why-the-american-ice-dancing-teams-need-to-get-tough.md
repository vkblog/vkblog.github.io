  On Friday night, I was watching the American ice dancing teams get murdered by the Russians , who for some reason, have been mangling  every sport.  It&#8217;s like they <em>want </em>Putin to murder them when they get back.  Although, now they are in <a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-figure-skating/schedule-and-results/ice-dance---original-dance_fsx030201Hb.html">third place</a>.  And, although they&#8217;ve been losing, they are scary, scary people and performed insanely well in the compulsory routine.  Specifically, Domnina-Shabalin scare the crap out of me with their ferocity (<a href="http://www.ctvolympics.ca/figure-skating/news/newsid=49216.html">also, racism</a>):

  If you look <a href="http://domnina-shabalin.ru/">at their fan site</a>, it says that they eat a koala for breakfast every morning.  Starting with murdering it in cold blood.
