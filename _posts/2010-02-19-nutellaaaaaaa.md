Remember when I was [trying to lose weight through the power of economics](https://vkblog.github.io/2009/11/10/this-is-how-economists-theoretically-lose-weight/)?  Well, I&#8217;m having another go at it.  So far&#8230;success!  Almost.    Also, remember how I used to have [links on Fridays](https://vkblog.github.io/2009/11/19/friday-links-for-the-doomed/) and then I stopped and you were probably like, what the heck?  Well, I got lazy.  So I&#8217;m going to try to bring them back. At least for this week.   After the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">trauma </span>comic.
