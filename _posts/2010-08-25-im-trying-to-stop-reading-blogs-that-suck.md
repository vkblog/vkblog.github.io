I&#8217;m in the process of unsubscribing from a bunch of blogs that I used to read because when I subscribed to them I thought it was cool to read those blogs.   I was a beginning blogger, and they appealed to me and I became wistful and awestruck at how many people were in their comment sections, how wonderful every paragraph they wrote was, how cute their stock photos were, and how they were whisked away to conferences and given blogger goodies.

But then a bad thing happened and I started writing like those bloggers and my writing style (as you probably noticed) became bland and formulaic. But then I realized I can&#8217;t do fake, cloying, and overly self-important. And then I discovered actual good bloggers who didn&#8217;t write by blogging templates or Copyblogger rules, who wrote about real life in a way that was interesting, who made me want to find out more about them.

I don&#8217;t want to read about Generation Y anymore, and I don&#8217;t want to read about how to make money from my blog.  I don&#8217;t want to read formulaic copy about why women should have Roth IRAs.

I want to read stuff that teaches me more about the world and that makes me feel like I&#8217;m a part of your life. I want to read bloggers whose writing is so good that it encourages me to work on my turn of phrase.   Most importantly, I want to read bloggers that don&#8217;t feel the need to try and impress me by being pretentious and specious and getting more blog hits.

I want to read about [girls that voluntarily work in the Emirates](http://gubbiofarabia.tumblr.com/), [people that describe life in Israel](http://www.treppenwitz.com/) in a style that is uniquely theirs, [about doctors that are also mothers](http://theunderweardrawer.blogspot.com/), and  [<p style="text-align: center;">

And I want to be a writer who inspires this kind of desire.
