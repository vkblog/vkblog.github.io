I can&#8217;t believe I made it to Friday!  It seems like it was just yesterday I was floating 10 miles above Colorado.

I decided to try something different today:

**Russia:**

[@ssmirnov](http://www.twitter.com/ssmirnov) [writes about her Russian husband](http://ssmirnov.wordpress.com/2009/08/24/russians-bearing-gifts/) and Russians bearing gifts
  
[Edward Burtynsky&#8217;s Oil](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/09/edward_burtynskys_oil?page=0,1)-stunning photos
  
[Bad, Bad Putin](http://readrussia.com/blog/art/00260/) art.

**Israel:**

The Middle East [conflict is&#8230;uh&#8230;solved](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8297599.stm)!
  
[Supporting Israel-It&#8217;s Complicated](http://www.forward.com/articles/114180/).  I was going to blog about this, but I don&#8217;t want to touch this one with a 10-foot Israel pole.

**Writing:**

[Americanisms](http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=673931)-how to avoid them.
  
A [great site I found](http://www.inkygirl.com/) by a writer who&#8217;s also doing NaNoWriMo!

**Econ:**

[China Solifdifies Its Lead in Global Trade](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/business/global/14chinatrade.html?hp)

**Etc:**

My [parents were awesome](http://myparentswereawesome.tumblr.com/).
  
[Beyonce singing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdd0YLvYYhk) the Nigerian national anthem.
