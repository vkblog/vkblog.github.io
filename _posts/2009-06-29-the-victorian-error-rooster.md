  <em>Note: The Victorian Era was a long period of prosperity for the British people, a time of cultural revival, and of great advances in engineering and fashion.  The Victorian Error is a weekly column where I bitch about my life experiences.<br /> </em>

  I recently read an article that said chickens are becoming <a href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/dpp/news/consumers/dpgo_chickens_urban_pets_lwf_061509_2575822">popular suburban pets</a>.  When I read this, I was delighted.  What better way to annoy the hell out of your neighbors than having a chicken?  Having a rooster, of course.  How do I know?  I shared the same space as a rooster the summer of junior year of college.  <em>Lived</em> is not the right terminology for what happened, because when you say <em>lived</em>, it usually implies you enjoyed it.

    It was the summer of &#8217;07, and I was interning in Philadelphia.  I have a lot of family that lives in the area, and my cousin graciously agreed to take me in for the summer.  I have a lot of respect for a person that lets me live with her, keeping in mind that I used to pinch her on the back as she was bending down to tie my shoes when I was five.  I settled down in the house, which was situated in a relatively wooded area and where the neighbors were well out of the way.  I went to bed early, not wanting to be late for my first day on the job. I fell asleep, my head full of excitement for what the next day would hold in the exciting world of executive compensation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At 4:48 the next morning, I woke up to a tone-deaf burglar trying to break into my window, five times in a row.  It sounded like this:
  </p>
  
  <p>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was jolted out of sleep, my heart racing like a heroin addict&#8217;s, looked out the window, scanning the green growth.  I looked around for something to throw at the intruder.  Since I was barley unpacked, the only thing I had was a roll of socks. I felt kind of bad throwing them out the window because I am a cheap Jew and I didn&#8217;t want to lose a pair of socks, even if it meant arresting the assailant.  The rooster crowed.  I thought about throwing the socks again.  My pecuniary fortitude prevailed. I slumped back down on the bed and covered my head with the pillow, curling into the fetal position.  The rooster crowed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I fetaled my way to 5:50 am and couldn&#8217;t take it anymore.  I got up for the day.  The next day, I passed my cousin in the hallway.  &#8220;Hey,&#8221; I put a hand on her arm.  &#8220;Do you guys have a rooster?&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Oh yeah, &#8221; she said, &#8220;the neighbors keep the rooster.  It&#8217;s a pain, but we can&#8217;t do anything about it,&#8221; with the same level of casualness as someone would say, &#8220;Oh yeah, the lint got stuck in the dryer again.&#8221;   I&#8217;d never seen a roster before, because I hadn&#8217;t grown up in Boone County, Iowa.  We had random roosters around at our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacha">dacha</a> when I was little, but I don&#8217;t even remember the time a bookshelf fell on my head.  How am I going to remember a rooster? Although, that fall does explain a lot about me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It was the same way every day that summer.  I threw away my alarm clock.  4:48 am was always exact, anyway.  The second night, I went to sleep dreaming of taking an axe to the rooster.  The third night, I dreamed of Russian roulette.  By July, I had thought up twenty-seven different ways to commit gallucide.  However, somewhere after July 4, I started getting used to the rooster.  He soothed me, in the same way that Beltway traffic is soothing: it&#8217;s an inevitable constant that sometimes leads to coronary failure.

    By August,  I had succumbed to fate.  I was even crowing a little myself.  I started talking to the rooster, like the heroine from <a href="http://russian-crafts.com/tales/morozko.html">Morozko</a>, who has to knit socks for her step-sister before the sun comes up, or her hair gets cut off by her wicked step-mother.  She begs the rooster not to crow so that she can finish the last few stitches (about 6 minutes in)*.  Except I was just talking to the rooster for the hell of it.

    I did end up learning a lot of valuable stuff on my internship. I think the most important thing I learned, was how to live with a rooster.

  <p>
    *Russians, I never understood why she wastes her time talking to the sun, the rooster, and whatevs. Why doesn&#8217;t she just finish the stitches? Ah, socialism.
