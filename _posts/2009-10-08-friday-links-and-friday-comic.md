It really does.  Click to enlarge.  Click to find out more about [Natan Sharansky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natan_Sharansky) (who I actually had the immense priviledge of meeting!), [Avigdor Lieberman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avigdor_Lieberman), and [Sukkot](http://www.jewfaq.org/holiday5.htm).

  1. This is a [damn shame](http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20310823,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines).
  2. [Nobel Prize for Literature](http://jezebel.com/5377092/behind-the-iron-curtain-herta-mueller-wins-nobel-prize-for-literature) didn&#8217;t go to me.  Again.
  3. I would be mad at the [Nobel Chemistry Winner](http://jezebel.com/5376589/great-chemistry), but she is just too cute with her family.
  4. [Palestinian Ocktoberfest](http://negevrockcity.com/post/205260841/palestinian-oktoberfest-moment)=Sweeeet.
  5. I love this [take on the Hezbollah flag](http://system-s.deviantart.com/art/New-Perspective-139382791), which says Islamic love instead of Islamic resistance.
  6. Great post, [some of which I disagreed with](http://modite.com/blog/2009/10/06/career-women-should-try-harder-%E2%80%93-especially-in-the-midwest/).  My comments at the bottom.
  7. [Russian intermarriage](http://windowoneurasia.blogspot.com/2009/09/window-on-eurasia-one-moscow-marriage.html) on the rise
  8. How [cool is](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Decorated_buses_of_Pakistan) this??
  9. Smart, [non-gimmicky](http://www.phillymag.com/health/articles/weighty_wisdom_governor_rendells_six_smart_tips_for_weight_loss/) weight loss
 10. How [not to suck at blogging](http://manvsdebt.com/how-not-to-suck-at-blogging/).  I try.  What do you think, how am I doing?  Is my content relevant and interesting to you?
