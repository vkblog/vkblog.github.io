Yesterday, I bought three pairs of shoes, because I need some fall shoes and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve bought shoes in the past year.  I particularly needed a nice new pair of work shoes, but since [DSW](http://www.dsw.com/) are heartless bastards, all of their nice work shoes cost more than $20 a pair, which is what I&#8217;ve been paying for the last 24 years, and which might explain why I constantly need new shoes.

I stood in front of the high heels section for a good half hour, trying to find a pair that didn&#8217;t have a heel that was higher than an inch (because high-heeled shoes destroy your back and if there&#8217;s anything more annoying than [being hypochondriac](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/03/15/whoever-said-life-is-about-adventure-and-risk-taking-never-had-typhoid-shots/) it&#8217;s being justified in being hypochondriac) and that was at a price I felt comfortable with.   I paced back and forth, trying to justify the $50 pricetag on a pair of shoes, because I&#8217;ve been brought up that you should never buy for full price if you can buy on sale. I didn&#8217;t know jeans cost more than $25 until I went to college.

It was a struggle within myself of herculean proportions as I picked out these shoes, took them to the register, took them back, bit my lip, sucked it up, and bought $50 shoes, because I am a Working Woman who has her own money and can have nice things, damnit.

Then I called my mom.

&#8220;Mom, you&#8217;ve ruined my childhood, &#8221; I said right off the bat.

&#8220;By sacrificing and bringing you to America?&#8221;

&#8220;No, by raising me to be cheap, in the family tradition.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m very proud of that.&#8221;

&#8220;Yeah, but now I can&#8217;t even buy a pair of shoes without feeling guilty and repneting afterwards.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m proud that I&#8217;ve taught you life skills.&#8221;

&#8220;Well, I bought myself a pair of shoes for $50 today, so ha!&#8221;

I paused a second.

&#8220;But I also bought two other pairs on clearance.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s my girl.&#8221;
