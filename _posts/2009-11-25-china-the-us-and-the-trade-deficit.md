At the point where Saturday Night Live stops being funny and starts being right, that&#8217;s the scare point.  I [wrote previously about China](https://vkblog.github.io/2009/07/01/bric-a-brac-china-messes-with-national-stats/), but this time they are clearly not in the wrong.



**ALSO!** Check out The Great Interview Experiment, [where I am being interviewed by Gayle](http://gcrispin.blogspot.com/2009/11/great-interview-experiment-2009.html), who is awesome and a comedian from Philadelphia and just got married (like me!  Only I&#8217;ve been married over a year.  But, like with PTSD, the wounds are still fresh. 😉 I talk about writing my novel, Israeli life, and which songs are on my MP3 player right now.  I&#8217;ve interviewed Otir for the experiment, and you can check out her [interview here](https://vkblog.github.io/2009/11/16/the-great-interview-experiment-2009-otir/).

Here&#8217;s an excerpt from my interview:
