At the point where Saturday Night Live stops being funny and starts being right, that&#8217;s the scare point.Â  I [wrote previously about China](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/07/01/bric-a-brac-china-messes-with-national-stats/), but this time they are clearly not in the wrong.



**ALSO!** Check out The Great Interview Experiment, [where I am being interviewed by Gayle](http://gcrispin.blogspot.com/2009/11/great-interview-experiment-2009.html), who is awesome and a comedian from Philadelphia and just got married (like me!Â  Only I&#8217;ve been married over a year.Â  But, like with PTSD, the wounds are still fresh. ðŸ˜‰ I talk about writing my novel, Israeli life, and which songs are on my MP3 player right now.Â  I&#8217;ve interviewed Otir for the experiment, and you can check out her [interview here](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/11/16/the-great-interview-experiment-2009-otir/).
