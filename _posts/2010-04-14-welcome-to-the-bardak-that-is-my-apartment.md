Mr. B and I are moving to [Pentagon City](http://www.commuterpage.com/art/villages/pentcity.htm) . I&#8217;m pretty sad, because I love our apartment and the fact that we were 20 minutes away from DC but could eat breakfast on our balcony facing the woods.We&#8217;re moving because it doesn&#8217;t serve the right purpose for us anymore.

What I love most about it is that we lived the first two years of married life here, instead of [communal-Soviet-style with our parents](http://books.google.com/books?id=e6bKPumAX1YC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=living+with+parents+soviet+union&source=bl&ots=CQE3aENYA7&sig=sGnO9rJPvWqQ8arkZOl0s8CAEas&hl=en&ei=-KjFS72_D4Sg9QSJpomUDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false) in the same one-bedroom apartment that was built during the Khruschev administration, like my parents and Mr. B&#8217;s parents did.  We lived sans parental interference and, in doing so, established a pretty solid foundation for decision-making in our marriage which will last us for years to come.

What is hard right now, though, is the clutter.  Oh, the clutter.

I knew that we&#8217;d be moving eventually, so I tried to keep the apartment as sparse as possible, free of crap.  Unfortunately, I&#8217;ve somehow failed, because we&#8217;ve been packing for two days now, mercilessly throwing stuff away left and right, with no end in sight.

&#8220;We&#8217;re hoarders,&#8221; Mr. B said.

Hoarders who still own unusually large bears named Luke that they&#8217;ve had since they were 11. Also paintings that they bought at flea markets for $5 and can&#8217;t get rid of.

The hardest thing for me is to [let go of  are things I&#8217;m emotionally attached to](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/women-and-happiness/201003/theres-downsizing-and-de-cluttering-why-not-just-get-rid-everything), or things that people have given me as presents that I HATE, but that I can&#8217;t throw away because, what if they ask about them?

On the one hand, I&#8217;m extremely flexible (because if I wasn&#8217;t, I would probably be going insane over the fact that we have spent maybe a total of 10-15 weekends in DC over the past two years in our traverse between my parents and Mr. B&#8217;s. )  This is probably because I have Mongol blood.  But, on the other, how can I ever, ever, ever give up any of my books?
