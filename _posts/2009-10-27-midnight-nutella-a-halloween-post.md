I am doing a lot of warming up for [I am doing a lot of warming up for](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/10/11/my-unborn-novel-is-annoying-me-nanowrimo/) beginning on Sunday.  This means annoying you with my attempts at literature.  Here is my latest, a Halloween poem in the style of Edgar Allen Poe on crack.

  <strong>Midnight Nutella</strong>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Oh, what horror!  Oh, what fright!<br /> Has arisen from the dead-<br /> What disturbs me on this night,<br /> What ghoul phantom rears its head?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  On the eve of Halloween,<br /> When all good souls are asleep-<br /> Ghosts of fears yet to be seen-<br /> Graze my forehead in my sleep.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  As I lay in bed, exhaling,<br /> Muffled footsteps near the door-<br /> My heart pounding, then a wailing.<br /> Like a gale upon a moor.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  So, I crept into the kitchen.<br /> Where the light was wan and yellow.<br /> Gasped in shock, for there was standing-<br /> An unopened jar-NUTELLA!
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  It did nothing-I skipped heartbeats.<br /> I had eaten it last night.<br /> Why now, suddenly, a sequel<br /> Here to tempt my appetite?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Had I not devoured slowly?<br /> Creamy chocolate with a spoon?<br /> Had I not thrown out the remnants?<br /> By the pale glow of the moon?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  It stood still.  My neck hair prickled.<br /> Were my eyes just playing tricks?<br /> Had some chocolate really trickled?<br /> From its lid, onto the bricks?
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Reaching for it to replace it<br /> To my pantry, on the shelf,<br /> When it bit me!  With its white fangs!<br /> Rasping, &#8220;I can move  myself.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  As I smarted from the contact<br /> I expounded, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t that rich!&#8221;<br /> It replied, matter-of-factly,<br /> &#8220;I&#8217;m haunting you &#8217;cause you&#8217;re a bitch!&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;Do you not have home recycling?<br /> Where you should have put me first?<br /> Do you spit upon our planet?<br /> Face it lady, you&#8217;re the worst!&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;And not only did you eat me,<br /> Quickly so Dan wouldn&#8217;t see,<br /> But as you made to deplete me-<br /> Lady, you just killed a tree!
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  It jumped up upon the counter<br /> With a force I&#8217;d never seen.<br /> And it hissed and made me flounder-<br /> Made me gasp on Halloween.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;Yes, we live in<a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/fsb/0803/gallery.best_places_to_launch.fsb/5.html"></a><a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/"> White</a> Bethesda,&#8221;<br /> I regained my power of speech.<br /> &#8220;But we&#8217;ve never used recycling,<br /> But I&#8217;ve never killed a beech!&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;Just because we seem like hipsters,<br /> Doesn&#8217;t mean we follow trends.<br /> Better stop giving me lip, sir!<br /> Let&#8217;s make up and make amends.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;Why&#8217;d you think we would recycle?<br /> Do we drink cafe au lait?<br /> Do we get to work by cycle?<br /> Do we crucify Bill Gates?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;Do we have Obama stickers?<br /> On our Prius in the drive?<br /> Do we post our shots on Flickr?<br /> Do we Livestrong while we&#8217;re alive?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;No, and no, and no, and no!<br /> We don&#8217;t recycle, I told you so!&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;Listen here you Russian reject,<br /> Oh, you communism waste,&#8221;<br /> The jar came on toward me slowly.<br /> &#8220;Soon enough, you&#8217;ll get a taste.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;It&#8217;s the folks who think like you-<br /> Who hate the earth, just as you do!&#8221;<br /> Oh, pollution, woe is me!<br /> Recycle, bitch, and be happy!&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  &#8220;Did you know that your recycling<br /> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling#Criticism">Doesn&#8217;t really help the earth</a>?&#8221;<br /> I said, trembling at its molars,<br /> &#8220;What&#8217;s the point? Where&#8217;s the worth?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  Many things then happened quickly.<br /> The jar leapt and I attacked.<br /> As its chocolate maw drew closer-<br /> I grabbed a spoon and beat it back.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  And soon, it was in a corner.<br /> Trembling, it let out a sob.<br /> With the jaunt of a new mourner,<br /> I opened it and ate a glob.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
  The evil spirit then departed,<br /> No longer haunting me in sleep.<br /> We were back where we had started-<br /> The can, in trash bags, in the deep.
