I&#8217;ve been thinking about writing a lot, lately.

This is partly because come November First, I&#8217;ll be [fevrishly writing a 50,000 word novel in a month](http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/user/510214). It&#8217;s got to be done.

You know how writers are like, &#8220;Oh, I have a novel inside of me,&#8221; and you want to punch them in the face because writers are the worst and they are crazy and also they might throw their Moleskine at you?  Well, I have a novel inside of me. I&#8217;ve had one ever since I was five years old and we&#8217;d just immigrated to America and I told my parents I was going to write my autobiography, I just needed to be filled in on the details of my birth.

Ever since then, I&#8217;ve been procrastinating. I&#8217;ve let ideas come and go.  I&#8217;ve toyed with an autobiography for years.  Then there was Christina and her magical pony, which graduated to May who lived in Maytown and was sent on a dangerous mission to December.  Then there was a spoof on Russian fairytales, a novel about early Zionism, and a political thriller about a Siberian oil magnate.  I&#8217;ve let every one of those ideas sit.  Because it didn&#8217;t feel right, and because it was too overwhelming to think about writing The Great American Novel.  Which was my plan all along.

But then I came across [Gary Shteyngart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Shteyngart) and [Shalom Auslander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom_Auslander) and [Suzanna Clarke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Strange_&_Mr_Norrell). And I knew if they could tell their stories in such a captivating and important way to me, then I could do it, as well, and make my voice known.

But.  This novel is annoying me as much as [my unborn children](../2009/09/30/my-unborn-children-are-annoying-me/) are annoying me.  And I gotta write it.  And finally I have a perfect set-up, I love my characters, and, best of all, I got the idea for the first couple lines on the flight back from [Israel](../2009/09/16/gods-is-straight-up-messing-with-me/).  Now that I am finally not busy with anything after work except rigorously watching Dog The Bounty Hunter and promising to myself that I&#8217;ll retake the GRE exam I took in May, I am going to write this damn thing.

And it&#8217;s probably going to be the most difficult thing I do because I am still going to blog, and I still have to have normal interactions with family members and, like, spend time with friends and stuff. And afterwards, I want to publish it. And I want it to be successful, and I want people to read it.  I will need your support, though, mostly because I&#8217;m whiny.  I will update you with my progress on the blog, and maybe ask some questions on what you think is feasible. I hope you&#8217;ll stay with me along for the journey, before I go insane.

Without further ado, here is my attempt for this year&#8217;s NaNoWriMo with its working title:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1419" title="Page_1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/10/Page_14.jpg" alt="Page_1" width="500" height="100" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/10/Page_14.jpg)

Please meet my main character and your guide through the novel, Michael Shtulman:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1420" title="Gelfand" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/10/Gelfand.jpg" alt="Gelfand" width="500" height="370" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/10/Gelfand.jpg)

Ok.  So it&#8217;s not really my character.  It&#8217;s actually [Boris Gelfand.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Gelfand) But it&#8217;s close to what Michael Shtulman looks like in my mind.  Only, he doesn&#8217;t wear glasses. Also, he is a bit more of a loser than Gelfand, who is a chess champion.

Mr. B suggested I use him as a model, but I think he&#8217;s a little busy right now.
