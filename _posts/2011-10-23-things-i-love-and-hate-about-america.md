<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWS-FoXbjVI" target="_blank">Things I love about America</a>:

  * The fact that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqDtf1aw818" target="_blank">everyone is <strong>optimistic</strong> here</a>.  Sometimes in an indignant way.  Like you tell someone, &#8220;There&#8217;s no way we can get that done,&#8221; and they&#8217;ll tell you, &#8220;Why not?&#8221; and it&#8217;ll be in an incredulous way.  Usually here, if you have grit and determination, you can do anything you set your mind to. Or, you&#8217;ll fail, but at least you&#8217;ll try instead of being resigned about it. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOobdhEE1_o&feature=related" target="_blank">  Anyone can make it here. </a>
  * Champagne mimosas for **brunch**.  Whoever <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTTiY7C0DRA" target="_blank">invented brunch is a genius. </a> Whoever invented champagne is even more of a genius.  Champagne is my beverage of choice, because I am an American and I value freedom.  I don&#8217;t even care if Champagne is French and <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=martini+asti&hl=en&prmd=imvns&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&biw=1504&bih=929&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=shop&cid=18410146429596922783&sa=X&ei=IKCkTsPYE4fc0QGg0MX8BA&ved=0CFYQ8wIwAA" target="_blank">my favorite brand is Italian</a>.  Here, we drink Freedom Fizz.
  * **Efficiency.**  What is efficient in America?  Everything. Drive-throughs. Parking spots for expecting moms.  Automatic checkout at the grocery stores.  1-hour drycleaning.  Returning stuff without receipts. Christmas in July.
  * **Innovation.  **High-tech.  San Francisco.  iPads. The fact that <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/big_ben_clock" target="_blank">Big Ben Tweets</a>.  It makes me so proud that we&#8217;ve compressed the invention of hundreds of years of technology into about 10 so that I can read BONG BONG BONG BONG BONG right now.
