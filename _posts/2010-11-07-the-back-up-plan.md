Since [the concert](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/10/24/bards-and-a-vanishing-breed-of-russian/) , I&#8217;ve been thinking about where I could meet Russian guys.

I mean, it&#8217;s not an active thing, but since you know how hypochondriac and fatalist and pessimistic  I am (not to mention the fact that God loves to mess with me), it&#8217;s only natural that Mr. B&#8217;s and my relationship is too good to last and something will happen to one of us (knock on wood. Not like it will help.)

P.S. Do you know what is a bad activity for people who are afraid of sudden diseases and body paralysis? Horseback riding!

So I&#8217;ve been brainstorming about where I could meet someone that fulfills all of the following criteria:

  * easy on the eye (this is numero uno criteria right here)
  * nice Russian Jewish boy
  * much smarter than me
  * is really good at his job and is intellectually curious
  * loves to talk about politics
  * is kind to animals, children, and wives drunk on champagne
  * will spontaneously dance to Youtube videos of [Since [the concert](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/10/24/bards-and-a-vanishing-breed-of-russian/) , I&#8217;ve been thinking about where I could meet Russian guys.

  * much smarter than me
  * is really good at his job and is intellectually curious
  * loves to talk about politics

  * believes women and girls can do anything, including eating cereal for dinner
  * will go to Jewish events with names like &#8220;Hookah in the Sukkah&#8221; and &#8220;Nosh Night&#8221; and  not complain
  * will actually purchase a hookah from shady man in Tel Aviv
  * will light said hookah without burning himself
  * thinks [my cooking is the best](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/08/25/me-elsewhere/) in the world even though what I do to chicken could technically be called genocide under the Geneva Convetion
  * will bullshit me and tell me I am attractive
  * will peel my oranges

It&#8217;s a pretty big list, but I am picking a person to spend the next X years with, not curtains.  The problem is that you cannot meet people like this in Philadelphia because it is hard to find orange peelers. Let&#8217;s break it down.

 **The natural habitats for many Eastern European men out and about in the Philly metro area include:**

  * Russian restaurants (BTW [it&#8217;s cute how the non Eastern Euorpeans](http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/305725) try to infiltrate our net)
  * The gym (Russian LA Fitness near Mr. B&#8217;s mom&#8217;s house)
  * Wherever there are foreign cars
  * Russian grocery stores

**My natural habitats include:**

  * The Russian gym, in the corner hiding from all the Russian ladies who are size negative 2
  * [The Russian restaurants](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/10/28/two-quick-pics-from-this-week/), at the table furthest away from the speakers, because- by God I think I&#8217;m going deaf from the music and what if I have to learn American Sign Language? did I mention I was fatalistic and pessimist?
  * My room, watching [Disney videos on Youtube in Hebrew](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og-bnjmY_ak)&#8211;I mean working on my novel and studying for the GRE
  * [The Philadelphia Free Public Library](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/10/17/scenarios/)
  * [Nerd situations](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/10/26/james-zogby-wins-me-over-with-his-lebanese-trickery-and-charm/) (ok, I have to admit that almost every outing I post on my blog is a nerd situation, so one link isn&#8217;t enough)
  * [Maoz](http://www.maozusa.com/)
  * The Russian grocery store Nutella aisle
  * [My grandpa&#8217;s apartment](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/06/02/if-my-grandpa-cant-come-to-the-pictures-they-come-to-him/)

So basically, there is no way I would ever come across Russian Jewish fellows unless I stepped up my game; namely, started being less like Belle ([WEIRD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IltAsKmVroQ)), or started to find places where weird guys hang out.  I&#8217;m thinking UPenn, in which case, it&#8217;s time to stop watching Disney clips and start hitting the GRE/GMAT books. Really hard. Like $41,000 worth of  Wharton MBA scholarships hard.  Back to Youtube it is for me.

Fortunately the only guy I&#8217;m interested in  can be found reliably in one place right now-with me from Friday night to midday Sunday. ( A++++, would marry again. )
