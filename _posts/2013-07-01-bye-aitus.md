So I have to work on my novel THIS MONTH or I&#8217;ll never finish it, like, ever because I&#8217;m taking 7 credits-7 CREDITS-next semester and also still doing the whole job thing.  I work on my novel every morning before work, like I get up at 5:45, 5:55 if I&#8217;m lazy then do the whole shower thing and then go downstairs to eat breakfast and by the time I&#8217;ve eaten it&#8217;s already 6:30 and I only have an hour to do my thing, but half of that hour is spent thinking about how I should be writing blog posts and the other half is spent thinking about how I should be learning Python and the third half is about something witty I should post on Twitter so by the time I get around to putting words down on a page, it&#8217;s already 7:15 and my train is at 7:40 and you cannot CANNOT start writing and get into the groove for 16 minutes until you have to leave and so my novel is a MESS.  And when I get home I&#8217;m busy trying to accomplish [all of my other summer goals.](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2013/05/summer-is-looking-too-ambitious/)

So I&#8217;m not blogging in July. I think. I hope it&#8217;s ok with you. Because I&#8217;m feeling pretty nervous about it.

But, I&#8217;m pretty nervous about everything.
