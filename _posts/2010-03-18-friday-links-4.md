And the insane abundance of great links I&#8217;ve come across.

**From the blogs:**

  1. Petya is all about [the Bulgarian idioms](http://www.howtomarryabulgarian.com/2010/03/how-to-learn-bulgarian.html) this week
  2. Roba posts Arab pop star Haifa Wehbe&#8217;s [new video](http://andfaraway.net/blog/2010/03/18/haifa-wehbe-goes-maximus/)
  3. A [way too personal post](http://www.alifeintranslation.com/2010/03/i-want-to-rip-my-skin-off-this-blog-post-is-way-too-personal/) that I think most people can identify with from time to time from Jamie
  4. [A great post from Rima](http://rimarama.blogspot.com/2010/03/why-my-children-are-bilingual.html), who I just found, on why her kids speak both Lithuanian and English
  5. And I just realized I don&#8217;t read nearly enough blogs by men.  Suggestions?
