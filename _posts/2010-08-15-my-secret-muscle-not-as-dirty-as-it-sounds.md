As I biked the last five miles of the thirty that I did on Saturday, I thought about what people&#8217;s motivations are for following through, on anything.

Well, actually no.

At that point, I was thinking more about whether to go home or to an emergency medical clinic, because I wasn&#8217;t sure if my legs would fall off.  But after I regained limb sensation, I really did think about what made people successful.

A year ago, even five months ago, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do it.  In fact, when I went bike riding for the first time with my parents last spring,  I barely made it 10 miles:

</p>

But more importantly, I didn&#8217;t want to.  I went along because my parents asked me to, but I wasn&#8217;t really into it. I wasn&#8217;t interested in riding bikes and nothing could make me interested until I decided it was something I wanted to do for myself.

This spring, I  started to seriously work out again, exhausted and frustrated at my post-wedding weight gain (wherein post-wedding means almost two years by this point) and my inability to get back in shape.

I still don&#8217;t have healthy eating down, and haven&#8217;t lost more than five pounds, and even that fluctuates up and down.  But I do feel better and have possibly gained muscle as a result of running 2-3 times a week, training for 5ks, and every other weekend or so, biking. And people have remarked that I do look like I&#8217;ve lost weight, so maybe I have.

So, how do you make someone want to do something? You can&#8217;t.  You can never motivate someone unless they are self-motivated.  Basic economics even has an axiom that economists use as a base: people are motivated by self-interest.   As a rule-of-thumb, it works.

How does someone become self-motivated?  The key for me is the willpower muscle. Magazines and psychological studies often tell us that we are motivated by rewards, such as a manicure after a week of weight loss or a trip to Starbucks after the gym. Or water and rest breaks halfway through a workout or study session.   But none of that works for me.  I lose all of my concentration and focus on the reward instead of the process of obtaining it.  I really have to just do it.

And once I just do it, it becomes easier and easier.  It&#8217;s hard to describe what the willpower muscle feels like, but if you&#8217;ve ever gritted your teeth and accomplished something without distractions, you know.  For me, it&#8217;s a firm, empty feeling in my gut which nothing can get past. There is no motivation to follow it except that it&#8217;s there and the more I push against it, the stronger it becomes and allows me to do what I need to get done.

This muscle used to be crazy  in college when I was up until 12 doing homework and then had three events to organize for my various groups the next day.  It&#8217;s  been in hiding for the past couple of years since I haven&#8217;t applied to grad school yet and spend many a night watching Jersey Shore instead of, say, thumbing through higher math books.  But this biking thing, this running thing, is putting it back into shape.

And I have to say, I&#8217;m really glad to have it back because it&#8217;s one of the things that makes me, me.
