Because I hate free time and love pain and misery, I&#8217;ve started working on my summer project, which is <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2012/05/i-basically-just-paid-myself-eight-cents-an-hour-to-learn-that-i-dont-need-an-mba/" target="_blank">my second book</a>.

Actually, I started pecking around a couple weeks ago, but I was busy wrapping up a product launch at work, my summer class at school, helping a friend with her wedding, and generally trying not to go insane. (which is why posting has been light lately).

Now I can 100% concentrate on the insanity.



And the insanity is going to be even worse than last time around, because I&#8217;m writing a historical novella, which means I have to TONS of research.

What is it about?

Are you ready?

You&#8217;re not ready.

_I&#8217;m_ not ready.

It&#8217;s about the <a href="http://jewistan.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Jewish Autonomous Region of Birobidzhan in the 1930s</a>.  It&#8217;s about life right before Stalin&#8217;s purges, clanedstine Zionist organizations, Americans, life in a planned city, potatoes, love, funny situations, vodka, Yiddish, Siberia,  the triumph of the human spirit, and this main character dude, who&#8217;s a huge jerk. Basically, I&#8217;m rewriting Doctor Zhivago, but editing for length and clarity and adding some humor in there because goddamn was the Soviet Union depressing.

Just kidding.  (Pasternak&#8217;s estate, don&#8217;t sue me.)

It&#8217;s hard going this time around not only because of the fictional component, but because I have to be historically accurate.
  
It took me three weeks to write the first chapter.   Any time a character so much as takes a smoke or a drink, it&#8217;s off to the Googles for me. Not to mention the background reading.  Here&#8217;s my stack, which doesn&#8217;t include what I have on the iPad or what I&#8217;ve read online.

[<img class="aligncenter" title="IMG_20120613_072307" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/06/IMG_20120613_072307-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="377" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/06/IMG_20120613_072307.jpg)

I&#8217;m also reading primary source material in original language, which is a self-imposed challenge since my Russian comprehension is at the 10th grade level, but my reading speed is at a fourth-grade level. Because I&#8217;m a speed-reader in English, it&#8217;s really frustrating. I&#8217;m hoping this challenge will force me to read better and more in Russian.<span style="text-align: center;"> </span>

Someone said once that the past is a foreign country, they do things differently there, and I&#8217;m finding that the rules of the past complicate things significantly.  But they also make it easier, since people have always been people.

I am just as excited about this project as I was about Scotland, which is saying a lot.

Anyway, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m up to.  Hope your summer is more sane than mine.
