On Sunday, I watched the Super Bowl.  And by watched, I mean pretended to watch it because, even after over 15 years in America since my early youth and attending [one of the biggest football schools in the country](http://www.psu.edu/), I still have no idea what the rules of American football are.  &#8220;Now the offensive team has a chance to complete a touchdown,&#8221; Mr. B caringly pointed out to me after I kept yelling at him that I had no idea what was going on. &#8220;Then they have four chances to make a play.&#8221;    How does he know these things?  Probably picked it up in Engineering school while I was slacking off in my Hebrew minor (Eich omrim &#8220;American football evades me&#8221; bivrit?)

What held my attention the most, though, wasn&#8217;t the actual Superbowl (which made things even more confusing since there were two people named Peyton ON OPPOSITE SIDES) but the commercials, which I watch every year as a barometer of the way [American society is slowly turning into the Roman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire#Theories_of_a_fall.2C_decline.2C_transition_and_continuity).  I personally am rooting [for the Gauls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix).

Which is where this came in:

](http://www.bostonherald.com/news/columnists/view/20100209why_are_those_super_bowl_ad_execs_so_mad_at_women/) 

Methinks there are a couple of things going on here.  First, for some reason, advertisers and America in general think men are now not masculine enough.  Hence, [websites like Art of Manliness](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/01/13/what-can-men-expect-of-women-now-that-were-not-in-the-1950s/) that try to bring men back to being Mad Men.  But-pro tip-if you&#8217;re already &#8220;manly&#8221; (whatever that means), you&#8217;re already doing it and not talking about it, and certainly not on blog discussion forums.

The best example I have of someone that&#8217;s &#8220;manly&#8221; is [my dad](https://vkblog.github.io/2009/06/21/happy-fathers-day/).  He has no clue what Art of Manliness is and he doesn&#8217;t spend days agonizing over whether he should grow a mustache or get a pair of Chinos.  But he has fixed everything in our house- our basement when it flooded, multiple cars over multiple years without taking them to a mechanic, our refrigerator, numerous televisions that other people would just throw out, my laptop, and on and on.   Additionally, he doesn&#8217;t let anyone talk smack about my mom and makes me feel safe.  And doesn&#8217;t brag it up that he&#8217;s being &#8220;all manly&#8221; and removing his skirt.  He&#8217;s also gone clothes-shopping with my mom numerous times. Newsflash: if you feel emasculated going shopping with your wife, you have more issues than a FlowTV can fix.

Second, women for some reason always need to be put down, as evidenced by this commercial:
  


And the text,

> “I will take your call. I will listen to your opinion of my friends. I will listen to your friends’ opinion of my friends. I will be civil to your mother. I will put the seat down. I will separate the recycling. I will carry your lip balm. I will watch your vampire TV shows with you &#8230; and because I do this, I. Will. Drive. The. Car. I. Want. To. Drive. Dodge Charger. Man’s Last Stand.&#8221;

That just sounds like marriage.  Not really making big sacrifices here, guys.   The proper response, I think, can only best be described [by this comment.](http://jezebel.com/comment/19188889/)
