I&#8217;ve been a pretty regular reader of Jezebel, a purportedly lady-friendly gossip/news/whatever blog owned by Gawker, for about 3 years now, and if you clicky clicky on the Friday Links usually, you&#8217;ll notice I get a lot of stories from there.  What I love most about it is that it (used to) feature women-centric stories that I would never be able to find on my own in mainstream media, bright shiny pictures of women doing stuff around the world, celebrity gossip with the requisite amount of snark, and daily women dilemmas (shaving, dressing correctly, etc.) all in one place.  In fact, for the past two years, Jezebel has steadily been my lunchtime date when I don&#8217;t eat with other people or when I&#8217;m too busy to eat away from my desk.

It used to be one of my favorite places online because not only were the stories good, but so were the comments.  In fact, [some of the commenters](http://emilylhauserinmyhead.wordpress.com/) were so good that I followed them from Jezebel and onto their own blogs, which I read to this day.  I&#8217;ve learned so many new things from Jezebel comments, from movies to books to how to pick a dress for my size.  My world has been expanded and enriched.  I&#8217;ve even learned how to comment better.

Then Gawker was hacked (including my Uname and Pword and I had to scramble to change everything.)

Then Gawker had an abortion of a makeover which resulted in Jezebel becoming much, much, much worse (shorter articles, more pictures, more stupid.) I don&#8217;t blame the writers; they&#8217;re just trying to keep up with their boss&#8217;s demands. But, most of the great original commenters have jumped ship.  The skeleton of Jezebel remains, but the spirit is gone.  Commenters, when nonexistent, are snarky beyond belief and extremely touchy to the point where it is impossible to make fun of anything. The articles are written under the guise of feminism, but meant merely to get pageviews and outrage.  Lots of false rage at things that shouldn&#8217;t be raged at.

So, what&#8217;s a girl to do?

I know you&#8217;re hoping I have an answer, but I don&#8217;t.  I still go to Jezebel occasionally, but my visits there have really dropped off in the last month or so.  Other people have been wondering the same thing, and there is [a list](http://ask.metafilter.com/168800/I-really-dont-care-about-Katy-Perry-Really), but as you can see, Jezebel fills a void that hasn&#8217;t been filled since in women writing for women, and it makes me sad.

I do love [The Hairpin](http://thehairpin.com/) (as I&#8217;ve mentioned before), but Edith, as brilliant as she is, can&#8217;t be all things at the same time and as a result, it&#8217;s not a place I would go to browse during lunch.

I know this comes across as a really petty post highlighting a first-world problem, but it underlines something important for me: there are not a lot of places for women to go for women-specific sites where they don&#8217;t get shouted down to, intimidated, or infantilized with pink backgrounds and lipstick graphics.  I want to read mainstream sites on their own. But I also want a woman-centric take on certain issues. And I don&#8217;t want to be talked down to, told to go on a diet, told how CUTE THAT SKIRT FOR THE SPRING SEASON IS!!!!, or if a guy is into me.  On the other hand, I don&#8217;t want to be told what feminists do and don&#8217;t do, to be drawn into a debate about fat acceptance, or have to read sites that have TRIGGER WARNINGS everywhere.  It&#8217;s a fine line, at least for me.

So, ladies.   Suggestions?

**UPDATE**: Here&#8217;s a list of stuff I&#8217;m using as a substitute, but it&#8217;s by no means comprehensive. Feel free to add your own links.
