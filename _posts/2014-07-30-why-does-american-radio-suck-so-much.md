Every time I start driving to get to work, <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/11/in-philadelphia-traffic-everyones-an-engineer/" target="_blank">I get progressively angrier</a>. Thankfully, this time my new job&#8217;s only 25 minutes away, but that&#8217;s 25 minutes of either radio or audiobooks. I love both audiobooks and public radio, and would highly recommend both to anyone doing a commute, but sometimes I get tired of  NPR gently telling me that global warming, racism,  ISIS and gluten-intolerance are all my fault,  and I  just want to listen to music.

The problem with American music stations is they SUCK. There is no other word for it. Which is why, when I&#8217;m at home, I usually listen to <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/12/this-post-is-kind-of-hipster-because-i-talk-about-old-school-radios-and-miss-them-but-i-also-love-my-ipad/" target="_blank">European radio</a>. But it seems unfair that the American listening public is subjected to the same 20-not even 40-songs over and over again, and even <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/pop-music-trends/23535/" target="_blank">those songs are all the same</a>.

Every day as I drive, I wonder in rage, not about measles outbreaks or genetically-modified vegetables, but why the hell the American public is ok with shitty radio.

I did a little digging, and aside from the fact that the American music industry is completely messed up, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vqshb/iama_vp_of_programming_for_a_large_american_radio/" target="_blank">I was surprised to find that I&#8217;m the key demographic for this bullshit</a>:

>   The Top40 format is generally targeted toward Women 18-34 years old. So, if you don&#8217;t fit into that life-group, you&#8217;re not likely to be interested in a lot of the music we play on those stations. Of course, Top 40 attempts to reach a broader audience as well including Men and most target teens/college students at night&#8230;.Women 18-34 are our bread and butter there.

>   These women are generally very busy. Often they&#8217;re trying to balance career, kids, appointments, etc. They&#8217;re in the car a lot but for relatively short periods of time. In order to keep their interest, we try to keep things very fast paced content-wise. We&#8217;re also doing our best to make sure that as soon as they turn on our station, they&#8217;re going to hear a very popular hit song. We don&#8217;t waste time with a lot of &#8220;filler&#8221; on these stations. Thus, most of the music you&#8217;ll hear is relatively new &#8211; released within the last two years or so. The DJs keep their breaks quick. We know we don&#8217;t have a lot of time to reel in these women.

  So basically I am listening to the music that&#8217;s targeted directly to me.  And I have to say I hate it, for the exact same reasons that Jia Tolentino rages against it in <a href="http://thehairpin.com/2014/07/why-i-have-to-be-so-rude" target="_blank">this Hairpin piece</a> on the newest terrible American song, &#8220;Rude&#8221;:

>   The first time I heard “Rude” I thought it was a 1-800-411-PAIN ad, because Detroit radio is <a style="color: #036237;" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2F411-pain%2Fhappy-411pain&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFzfZdxlXDxNkYDJub0JW5sc055QQ" target="_blank">currently running one</a> that sounds sort of like a more palatable version of “Rude.” The next couple of times I had the sort of physical reaction I associate with suddenly coming in contact with bees; before my mind could process what was happening, I pawed at my radio dial quickly, <em>ahhh, get it away</em>!

  Get it away from me, and by it I mean mindless American radio. I suppose I could subscribe to Pandora or Spotify or play Grooveshark mobile, but that defies the whole point of this rant which is that I&#8217;m a music snob and all 50 million or howevermany 18-34 women there are should listen to the stuff I listen to, which is all this stuff. Get on it, radio stations.

NPR, if you&#8217;re listening, maybe you can throw some of this in between alarmist reports of ebola or farming bluefin tuna. Or better yet, instead of.
