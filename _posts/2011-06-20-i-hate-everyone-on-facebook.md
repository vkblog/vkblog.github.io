Mr. B and I are burnt out after a month of non-stop house doings culminating in a 35-person party that we planned and executed 80% by ourselves, which means we need a vacation.  We are also broke and sans vacation days, which means we can&#8217;t take one (or at least a good one. A good vacation is defined as any vacation where you get the hell out of America for at least a week. All-inclusives in Mexico do not count as getting the hell out of America.) And, and for the past week, we&#8217;ve been fighting a monster cold, which means we can&#8217;t see anyone locally because we&#8217;ll infect them.

The other reason we can&#8217;t see anyone locally is because 98% of our friends are on vacation.  But apparently not on vacation enough to not be on Facebook about it:

      Needless to say, I am taking a vacation.
