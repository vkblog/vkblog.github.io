Right on the heels of the <a href="http://akhilak.com/blog/2011/07/27/problems-with-poverty-tourism/" target="_blank">whole Bangladesh situation</a>, I&#8217;m having my own moral dilemma.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I asked Mr. B for an iPad for my birthday, because I want to be able to share <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/06/02/if-my-grandpa-cant-come-to-the-pictures-they-come-to-him/" target="_blank">large online pictures with my grandpa</a>, cook by an online recipe without printing it, read The Economist everywhere, read books on my commute, and send those &#8220;Sent from my iDevice&#8221; smug little emails to everyone, because I have too many friends right now.   He was happy to oblige because, as I have a feeling, it will become the family iPad.  Also, I totally need it <a href="http://www.myipadapps.com/daedalus-touch-app-for-ipad/" target="_blank">as an investment</a> into working on my novel. Yes.

  He IMed me yesterday to let me know that it is on its way, and I tracked the shipping:

  which made me sad.  I mean, I know that Apple products are manufactured in China, but somehow the fact that it&#8217;s being shipped directly from China reminds me that Apple products <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/monotony-blamed-for-company-suicides-20110802-1i8yp.html" target="_blank">are manufactured by a sweatshop</a> where people kill themselves because of the work of assembling electronics but have no real choice because they are getting paid. Plus, not only are people committing suicides, there was <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/20/explosion-at-foxconns-chengdu-plant-injures-several-could-affe/" target="_blank">an explosion at the place</a> my iPad is being shipped from not too long ago.
</p>

However, not to worry, because <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-news/global-exchange/financial-times/foxconn-looks-to-a-robotic-future/article2116857/" target="_blank">all the workers are being replaced by robots</a> soon!

So, my question is this.  By buying an iPad, am I voting with my money and letting Foxconn know that it&#8217;s ok to continue treating their workers as such? But wouldn&#8217;t the iPad be made anyway, therefore it doesn&#8217;t matter whether I or someone else bought it?  Is it ok that I&#8217;m sending money to China, which contributes to overall economic growth and a gradual increase in living conditions for all, or is it worse because my actions directly pressure peoples&#8217; lives?  Are the robots better?  From an economic standpoint, it doesn&#8217;t matter.  As long as the work is more efficient, that&#8217;s the way the markets will swing.  But what are the moral implications? Especially since this evil, I know.  But what about the rest of the things I consume that come from nameless factories in Southeast Asia?

I&#8217;m very conscious that boycotts are not effective, simply because we sometimes don&#8217;t know everything that&#8217;s going on.  For example, <a href="http://repository01.lib.tufts.edu:8080/fedora/get/tufts:UA015.012.DO.00026/bdef:TuftsPDF/getPDF" target="_blank">boycotts often don&#8217;t go the way they intend to</a> (PDF) (Israel, Iran, Cuba, etc.)

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2LBICPEK6w" target="_blank">I&#8217;m not going to start asking for Colin&#8217;s papers</a> anytime soon, but I want to know how other people think about this.

I know, this is such a first-world problem.  But as someone from a country whose fate was very similar to China&#8217;s under communism, I&#8217;m conscious that people elsewhere live like crap, and maybe something I do can change it.
