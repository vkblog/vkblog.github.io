I promise.  I was just on a mini-vacation (which I&#8217;ll blog about soon), and so now I&#8217;m catching up.  Mini-vacations tend to make me happy, so I have nothing to kvetch about.  However, there is an episode developing that will prove to be delightfully funny if all goes right and terribly horrible if all goes wrong, so stay tuned!

Do you have something to kvetch about?  Leave it in the comments.
