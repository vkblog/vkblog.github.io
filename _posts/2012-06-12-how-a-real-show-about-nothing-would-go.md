Every Saturday, 1:12 PM, every <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/18/dining/18rego.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Uzbek-style restaurant</a> in any city in America.

—Oh, Ludochka! That was such a great meal. I&#8217;m licking my fingers!

—I know! Wasn&#8217;t it, Verka? Those shashliki.  That kartoshka! Mmm. \*reaches for the last of the plov\* This place is the best.  Now what were you saying about your son?  He&#8217;s done with pharmacy school, right?

— Yes, Mishka just graduated, but he decided he doesn&#8217;t want to be a pharmacist! Can you imagine! After $100,000 of our blood, sweat and tears, he decides he doesn&#8217;t want to be a pharmacist! He quit after his first week! He could have told us that before we made him take the exam.  And now what girl is going to look at him?  It&#8217;s not stable!

— What a horror. What a horror. (_Uzhas, uzhas._) Remember when he was small and you stayed up with him all night when he had a fever?  So many nights spent&#8230;and this is what you get back! What an ungrateful swine.  So what&#8217;s he going to do now??

— Oh, God only knows.  Ludochka, don&#8217;t even talk to me about it.  My nerves are all destroyed. \*takes a strong sip of tea\* How&#8217;s your Dashenka?

—Oh, she&#8217;s not bad. Not so great, either. You know that art history major I told her not to get? Well, she&#8217;s going for it, anyway. What is she going to do with an art history major? She&#8217;s going to be an art expert right back in her old high-school bedroom, that&#8217;s what.  Ten years. TEN YEARS I&#8217;ve slaved away at this job as a programmer so she can have a good college education. Her father and I came with nothing. WITH NOTHING. All for her.  And how does she repay me? Wit this! This art history.

—Be strong, Lud&#8217;ka. Be strong.  Maybe if we have them marry each other, they can live in one of our houses and be ungrateful swine together. \*nibbles on the last of the bread\*

\*waitress comes with the check\*

—Ready, ladies?

\*waitress puts check down on table\* \*both women look at it like wolves look at prey\* \*waitress leaves\*

—Oh yes, I believe we are. \*gets out credit card\*

—Verka, what are you doing?  \*also gets out credit card\*

—I&#8217;m paying for lunch, Luda! And I don&#8217;t want to hear another word about it!

—Verka, no. There&#8217;s no way you&#8217;re paying for lunch.  You have a whole family on your shoulders again, you have Mishka to worry about, let me do this one thing for you.

—Luda, no. I&#8217;m perfectly capable for paying for myself, and that&#8217;s it. \*grabs check\* Besides, you brought the wine. That&#8217;s it-_Vsyo!_

—Vera, no. Listen to me.  Remember how last time you paid?  Now I owe you. That&#8217;s it. No arguments. \*grabs check and starts to look at it\* _Vsyo!_

—Lud&#8217;,  nu come on. Don&#8217;t hooligan.  \*hits her lightly on the hand\* Let me just pay for this, you can pay for the tip.

—Vera, don&#8217;t even talk about it.  Look at how you&#8217;re acting. A grown woman. I&#8217;m paying for lunch. \*puts credit card in check holder\*

—Luda, you are impossible.  \*takes credit card out, slams it on the table, puts her credit card in\*  I am PAYING for your lunch, and that&#8217;s it.

—\*takes check, takes credit card out, and pays entirely in cash\* If you want, you can leave the tip.  I&#8217;m paying, and that&#8217;s final.  I don&#8217;t even want to hear another word about it. _Vsyo__._

\*waitress comes by\* Are you ready?

\*Luda hands her the check, smiling\* Yes, we are

\*Vera is deflated\*

—Ok, but I&#8217;m paying for the tip, and that&#8217;s it. Look at how you behave. Embarrassing! You won&#8217;t even let a friend enjoy her meal.  Next time, I&#8217;ll pay.  And I&#8217;ll bring Misha.

—And I&#8217;ll bring Dasha.

—_Vsyo._
