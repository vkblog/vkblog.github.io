I am looking for someone to give our house a good spring cleaning.  Here&#8217;s a before shot:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2012/03/abandoned_soviet_library.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6603" title="abandoned_soviet_library" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2012/03/abandoned_soviet_library.jpg" alt="" width="518" height="382" /></a>
</p>

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, Mr. B and I spend around hours every week cleaning our house.  But as soon as it&#8217;s clean on Sundays, it magically starts to become dirty again, and thus the cycle restarts.  We also haven&#8217;t deep-cleaned for months, meaning there are some corners where it&#8217;s possible the fifth dimension exists amongs the lush vegetation and spider webs. Our <a href="https://vkblog.github.io/2011/08/our-domovoi-americans-hes-just-a-short-invisibile-bearded-dude-that-lives-in-your-home-no-biggie/" target="_blank">domovoi </a>is probably angry.

When you add the fact that right now my MBA and the ebook have top after-work priority, and for Mr. B is working on two online classes, you get something extremely terrifying.

So, Mr. B and I are trying to hire someone to take care of it in a deep spring cleaning.  The problem is that we are afraid of Russian cleaning ladies and even more afraid to hire an American one that we don&#8217;t know.

This is how our conversation about it went the other day.

Me: Maybe we should hire someone Russian?  Don&#8217;t you know some family members that have cleaning ladies?
  
Mr. B: \*pointed look\* Yes, but do you really want that?
  
Me: What do you mean?
  
Mr. B: Cause they&#8217;re going to come by and sooner or later it&#8217;ll get back to us. &#8220;Oh, Vicki and Mr. B?  THAT Vicki and Mr. B? Yeah, my aunt&#8217;s sister&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s brother&#8217;s niece cleaned their house last week, and let me tell you all about it.
  
Me: Good point.
  
Mr. B:  Do you really want some Russian women you don&#8217;t know telling the Russian women you do know what&#8217;s inside of your house and what a disgrace it is?
  
Me: Hm.
  
Mr. B: \*mimics older Russian woman in Russian\* Oh, Zoyachka. Those young people, the way they live-I disapprove of everything. And let me tell you all about it.

So, we are still looking for a house cleaner. Preferably one that won&#8217;t murder us, or gossip about us. Although at this point, I don&#8217;t know which is worse.
