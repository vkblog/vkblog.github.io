I ran a <a href="http://jenkintown.net/summer-sunset-5k-run/" target="_blank">5k last week</a> (Mr. B was still &#8220;recovering from illness&#8221;.) Because we haven&#8217;t run <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/04/11/our-cherry-blossom-run/" target="_blank">in over a month</a> since we were busy with house stuff, this was the hardest race I&#8217;ve ever run, especially since the second half was uphill. Can you tell?

I barely managed to finish under 40 minutes, but that&#8217;s ok, because two things were in my favor: the free pretzels afterwards:

and the fact that I got a new pair of running shoes because I accidentally left my old ones out in the rain and they acquired a smell I can only imagine is imported directly from the public toilets in Moscow.

The thing about running shoes is that once you run a lot, you need special shoes, and a special person to tell you what kind of shoes you need.

Here&#8217;s what I learned about my running style after going to the running store:

  * I have VERY nice arches.  I should consider becoming an arch model.
  * I maybe should consider picking shoes by criteria other than &#8220;They look really hot.&#8221;
  * I run about 10 miles a week, which isn&#8217;t really that much and maybe I don&#8217;t need special running shoes.  Maybe I&#8217;m not even really a runner, like the shoe store dude is.
  * Shoe store dude runs, like, 50 miles a week.
  * I hate the shoe store dude.
  * I love my shoes.
  * Mostly because they are blue, not because they are actually comfortable.
  * I really hope the shoe store dude doesn&#8217;t see me running the 5k.
  * I can never go back to this store again.
  * But I have to, because Mr. B needs new running shoes, too.
  * I thought Mr. B was too sick to run?
  * Apparently being too sick to run doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t get bangin&#8217; new shoes.
  * Time to register for the next 5k so Mr. B can start running again, too.
  * Preferably one that goes uphill both ways.
  * And one where the running store dude makes you look bad.
  * Because he not only finishes ahead of you, but does another lap, just for fun.
  * I wonder what kind of running shoes running store dude wears?
  * Those must be his secret.
