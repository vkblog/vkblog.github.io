I am so excited about this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/magazine/my-familys-experiment-in-extreme-schooling.html?pagewanted=4&_r=2&ref=world" target="_blank">NY Times article about American kids</a> learning Russian and going to a Russian school in Moscow.  Because it&#8217;s about time those hipsters get a taste of their own medicine. And by hipsters I mean American parents and teachers that teach their kids that each one is a special snowflake. More <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/education/10math.html" target="_blank">Americans</a> need to <a href="http://www.gse.harvard.edu/news_events/ed/2007/winter/features/geography.html" target="_blank">learn how</a> <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1025" target="_blank">the rest</a> of the <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/answer-sheet/civics-education/what-americans-dont-know-about.html" target="_blank">world works</a>.

Here&#8217;s a video where Mr. B and I recall our memories of learning English, and <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2005/2005021.pdf" target="_blank">debate</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/us-falls-in-world-education-rankings_n_793185.html" target="_blank">why</a> the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/04/education" target="_blank">American</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/13825184" target="_blank">school</a> system is terrible, but mostly just talk about nothing. It&#8217;s like a real-life Seinfeld, only with horrible production quality. Guess what? They don&#8217;t teach iMovie in American schools, either.

_I would LOVE if you included your memories of being integrated into the American school system and learning English in the comments.  Let&#8217;s swap horror stories.  Or how we completely mischaracterized American education.  Or talk about why you&#8217;re a Special Snowflake and don&#8217;t know 7 times 7. _
