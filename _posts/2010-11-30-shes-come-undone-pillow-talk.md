I&#8217;ve been falling apart over the last couple of weeks.

I&#8217;m not sure whether it&#8217;s the refugee lifestyle, the lack of husband, t[he commute](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/11/22/in-philadelphi…es-an-engineer/), the [SKRUG](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/11/18/skrug/), the lack of embassy networking events in Philadelphia, the GRE test looming on my calendar when I don&#8217;t even remember what the formula for a circle arc is, or the fact that this is what I see when I leave work (yes, antlers and the nose. _the nose_.):

Mainly, I think it&#8217;s the pillows.

When Mr. B isn&#8217;t around, I&#8217;m used to sleeping on [two pillows](http://whitewhine.tumblr.com/) (and with a spoon). Thus it has been since God created the Earth or second grade, whichever came first.   However, his joyous arrival last Wednesday night for the four-day Thanksgiving holiday resulted in a  [razkulachivanye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak#Dekulakization) of my pillows, meaning I was down to one for four days in a row.

I can deal with a lot of [indignities](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/09/13/blogging-with-integrity-i-hate-small-talk/).

But I cannot deal with sleeping on one pillow.

&#8220;Can you move over so that our pillows overlap and I can at least pretend like I have two pillows,&#8221; I whispered lovingly to Mr. B in the dark.  But, alas, among the many gifts that God bestwoed upon Mr. B in his infinite wisdom, one of them is that he doesn&#8217;t wake the hell up for ANYTHING (he has once slept through a fire alarm.)  I poked him several times, but to no avail.

The next day I woke up feeling a bit procrustean, but no big deal.  I figured I could stretch out and all would be ok.  When I stretched to the right, I heard an enormous crack, not unlike the bursting of a dam, and then, I couldn&#8217;t turn my head to the right  without experiencing pain on the lower right side of my neck.

I tried again and panicked.

I poked Mr. B again.  &#8220;Wake up, I think I&#8217;m going to die.&#8221;

Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t much cause for alarm since I usually wake him up this way.

&#8220;Do you have a cold,&#8221; he said, rubbing his eyes without the slightest sense of emergency.

&#8220;No, I&#8217;m falling apart at the seams.  I think I have tetanus.  That&#8217;s the one where your muscles freeze up after you step on something, right?  I think I stepped on an almond in the kitchen yesterday. I can&#8217;t turn my head to the right. I think I sprained something.  Or tetanus.  Or lockjaw. &#8221;

&#8220;Let me try,&#8221; he said, and twisted my head.

&#8220;OW,&#8221; I said, because it really did hurt.

&#8220;So don&#8217;t turn your head that way,&#8221; Dr. Boykis advised.

&#8220;This happened because you took my pillow.  I can&#8217;t sleep on less than two,&#8221; I angrily confronted him.   &#8220;Or maybe because I sit in traffic almost three hours a day,&#8221; I mused to myself.

&#8220;_Or maybe an autoimmune disease_,&#8221; my subconscious gently murmured.

Mr. B shrugged and went back to sleep. Living with a hypochondriac has made him soft.

Although when he was sleeping, I took his pillow.  Because you never know.

_By the way: no, there&#8217;s no way in hell I&#8217;m googling my neck problem in case Dr. WebMD is there to tell me I have  early onset dementia.  At this point, I&#8217;m  just hoping it kind of goes away on its own if I ignore it, kind of  like the Gulf Oil spill. And by ignore it I mean touch it and try to massage my neck every five minutes. If you don&#8217;t hear from me over the next week, it means they had to remove my neck._ 

_P.S. Ok, I just googled it.  [I&#8217;ve been falling apart over the last couple of weeks.
