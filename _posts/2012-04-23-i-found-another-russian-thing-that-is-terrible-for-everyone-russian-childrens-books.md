So, the other week, Mr. B and I were trolling around in the <a href="http://www.philadelphia.com/knizhnik-bookstore-b24488862" target="_blank">local Russian bookstore</a>. It&#8217;s actually very cute because it&#8217;s called &#8220;Knizhnik,&#8221; which loosely translates to &#8220;Booker,&#8221;  from the word for book, knizhka. It&#8217;s named after the owner, whose last name IS actually Knizhnik.  With a last name like that, I can only imagine you&#8217;re destined either for book store ownership or tax evasion.

Anyway, none of that was  relevant to the picture I&#8217;m about to show you. Brace yourselves.

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This book is titled &#8220;Magical Riddles,&#8221; but the only riddle I have is why the hell the wolf on the cover of a book targeting the 3-7 age group is dressed like Tupac Shakur? With his own bling, which reads &#8220;волк &#8221; or wolf in Russian.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  When I first Tweeted this picture on Instagram, a couple of Concerned Citizens pointed out that, even in English, it looked like the wolf was up to no good:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-22-at-10.36.34-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6754" title="Screen shot 2012-04-22 at 10.36.34 PM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/04/Screen-shot-2012-04-22-at-10.36.34-PM.png" alt="" width="558" height="257" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I have no explanation for this cover illustration and why it&#8217;s appropriating American gangsta rap culture.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
   Are Russians hoping to corner the hip-hop marketing segment of children&#8217;s literature? Do they think the wolf (W-Dawg) appeals to those 4-year old toddler girls who are dreaming of someone sexy and dangerous, yet safe, to escort them to Grandmother&#8217;s house? (Yes, that is little Red Riding Hood, but in Russian she&#8217;s Little Red Riding Cap, because, you know, communists)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  More importantly, if the wolf  can afford bling, why can&#8217;t he afford a nice pair of Prada pants without patches, like Kanye? Is it because the illustrator is trying to show that, while daddy has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9M6E-VAJ4w" target="_blank">a Boomer</a> and a 14-k gold nameplate he&#8217;s still relatable to the proletariat?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We many never know.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But while you&#8217;re puzzling over that, there&#8217;s another Russian children&#8217;s series I&#8217;d like you to check out.  It&#8217;s called Tanya Grotter and it has no resemblance at all to anything in English-speaking culture whatsoever.
</p>

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This pacticular book is called &#8220;Tanya Grotter and the Hammer of Perun,&#8221; Perun being the Slavic pagan deity of fire, mountains, and plagiarism.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I can just imagine a marketing meeting where the publishers of these books got together.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;How can we sell our own rich literary culture, spanning back hundreds of years and including such beloved Russian children&#8217;s authors as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuil_Marshak" target="_blank">Marshak</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agniya_Barto" target="_blank">Barto</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Nosov" target="_blank">Nosov</a>?&#8221; One suit says to another.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;We can&#8217;t.  Now that everyone has the Internet, Russian culture is boring. America, America, America, they all want.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;So what are we going to do?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;We will plagiarize and appropriate everything, by God.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;ALL of American and Anglophone culture?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Yes, all of it.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;But it&#8217;s so overwhelming! Where do we start?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;How about you draw a Hip Hop wolf, and we&#8217;ll go from there?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;But even if we develop a hip hop culture, we don&#8217;t have the &#8216;hood. How do we rap without a &#8216;hood to objectify?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Are you looking around you?  You have a whole country full of rusting post-Soviet machinery that hasn&#8217;t been maintained in over 40 years  just waiting to give you tetanus, and you&#8217;re complaining that we don&#8217;t have a &#8216;hood? Get back to drawing that wolf, bratan.&#8221;
