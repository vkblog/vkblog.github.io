Yesterday was cold and blustery and, apparently, [the most depressing day in January](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Monday_(date)).

However, I didn&#8217;t care too much because not only did Mr. B stick around  a little longer this weekend, but since both me and my mom had off work, she came to Philly to visit me and we went with Mr. B&#8217;s mom and my aunt to Center City Philly.

And what I learned is that it doesn&#8217;t always matter where you are (ahem, D.C.). It&#8217;s usually who you&#8217;re with that does.

We first went to the [Art Museum](http://www.philamuseum.org/), which I&#8217;ve been to a million times. But, it was still nice to get some culture.  I&#8217;ve been culture-deprived since November.  I wonder if I have scurvy.

I don&#8217;t know why, but watching my mom look at art makes me really happy.

  I think because it makes her really happy.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  What I also found out was that we need go back to the 1700s because back then normal-looking women were considered beautiful. I mean, look at <a href="http://www.lib-art.com/imgpainting/2/5/8652-the-rape-of-europa-noel-nicolas-coypel.jpg">Europa on Zeus as a bull</a>. Girl is at LEAST a size 12 and lookin&#8217; good.  Did togas have sizes?

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  After the museum, we went to <a href="http://www.maxbrenner.com/">Max Brenner</a> for lunch. Max Brenner is one of my favorite restaurants in Israel, and I was really excited to find out that they had a location in Philadelphia.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It&#8217;s pretty sweet, literally, because the place is built to resemble a chocolate factory and they specialize in deserts, but the food is really good and the portions aren&#8217;t huge.  Again, the best part wasn&#8217;t eating good food, but taking my mom, Mr. B&#8217;s mom, and my aunt to a restaurant they&#8217;d never been to before and were really excited to discover.  And sitting, talking, eating, and laughing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Then, afterwards, we went to visit my grandfather. During the visit, he told us that he wanted us to provide him with a checklist of all the things he needed to do to go to heaven. Then I think he told a Stalin anecdote. He always tells a Stalin anecdote.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The whole day, I was experiencing the &#8220;happiness&#8221; that psychologists always talk about but seems unattainable because we are all constantly stressed out. Happiness that came from the fact that I could drive while the women in my life relaxed and gossiped.  Happiness that they derived happiness from the museum and that they loved the restaurant.  Happiness that I was spending time with them.

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    It seems from personal development blogs that there are a million ways we can be happier: repriorotize our time, lose weight, learn to cook like a chef, go to a spa, buy a new dress, take pills.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Sometimes it&#8217;s a lot simpler than that.
