This is how you do it, kids. Go to a Russian restaurant, that is.

Note how I&#8217;m recycling [my work clothes](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/09/28/please-help-me-look-less-like-gaga-and-more-like-coco/) into evening wear.  [Here&#8217;s a song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypw0x55km5Q&feature=related) you can play to emulate our experience (in more than one way; the chorus is &#8220;I know you&#8217;re far away, between us are cities and cities.&#8221;) Just turn the lights off and pretend you are dancing to a guy named Shurik weighing upwards of 250 pounds and wearing a gold chain and a knockoff D&G shirt.  Also please note that I&#8217;m not bow-legged in real life. (I felt this was important to clarify.)
