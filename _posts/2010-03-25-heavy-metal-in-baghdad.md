So, I watched [this documentary yesterday](http://www.vbs.tv/watch/acrassicauda--2/heavy-metal-in-baghdad-feature) and realized I have nothing to complain about in life.

You never hear about how real Iraqis, especially educated Iraqis, live, trapped, beyond the headlines.  The closest experience I can think of was living in Tel Aviv during the 2006 war with Lebanon and feeling for two months like the sky was going to come down on me any second.   At night, I couldn&#8217;t sleep because every car door slamming below my apartment window meant a Katyusha from Hezbollah.  But that was NOTHING compared to what these guys have gone through.  Watch and enjoy.
