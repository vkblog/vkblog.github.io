No post today (working on one), so for now just enjoy Terry Gross figuring out how to reference crack cocaine and not offend a public radio audience while [interviewing Jay-Z](http://www.npr.org/2010/11/15/131334322/the-fresh-air-interview-jay-z-decoded).  She also says bitches and hos.  For realz.
