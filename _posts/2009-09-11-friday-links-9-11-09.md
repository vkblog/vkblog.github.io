Today is September 11.  That&#8217;s crazy.  I can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s been eight years since 9/11.   I remember when it first happened, I was in 10th grade and didn&#8217;t really process what was going on. I thought it was a joke.  I still haven&#8217;t.

  1. [Russian aliyah (immigration to Israel) has rescued Israel](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1251804500898&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull), says Bibi, as he kisses major voter butt
  2. [How to wear a ghotra.](http://saudijeans.org/2009/09/07/how-to-wear-a-ghotra/) Not that I ever will, but I wish I could.
  3. Help [write  a chick lit novel](http://www.slate.com/id/2227430/) in real-time.
  4. Neil, a great writer for all blog posts, is especially good at [family history](http://www.citizenofthemonth.com/2009/09/04/family-history/).
  5. A [dialectical Marxist critique](http://daddytypes.com/2009/09/08/the_triumph_of_the_crayolatariat.php) of the Crayola Factory.  Amazing.
  6. [Bibi goes to Moscow](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2009/09/israel-prime-minister-netanyahus-secret-trip.html), shady-like.
  7. [Rafael Nadal](http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/15491/israeli-causes-hubbub-at-us-open/), Mr. B&#8217;s favorite tennis player, is surprised.
  8. How cool is this! [A trans-Siberian train ride](http://www.justinprime.com/greattrainride/).
  9. Don&#8217;t you wish [your last name was hot](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3773541,00.html) like mine?
 10. [Hating on Michael Cera](http://www.sexdrugsandjunecleaver.com/2009/08/03/omnicera/).
