I haven&#8217;t been blogging because every time I sit down to blog, my mind goes to my summer classes, work, or completely out the door.

Last weekend, it went to Seattle and Portland, where Mr. B and I spent a couple days on sanity leave (aka vacation.)  Much more on that later, but for now, here&#8217;s one of my favorite pics from the trip, from <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/washington-state-ferries-seattle" target="_blank">the ferries</a> to Bainbridge Island. I think it pretty much sums up the Pacific Northwest.

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  On vacation, I was devouring <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bronze-Horseman-Paullina-Simons/dp/0061031127" target="_blank">The Bronze Horseman</a>, which is an excellent vacation read because it is a lighthearted romance set during the Siege of Leningrad.   By light-hearted, I mean that <a href="http://it.stlawu.edu/~rkreuzer/pcavallerano/leningradweb.htm" target="_blank">people were resorting to cannibalism</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Aside from that bit, it&#8217;s an emotional, heartbreaking and funny and beautiful book and I highly recommend it as a vacation read when you&#8217;re relaxing and don&#8217;t want to at all to think about why the author would mention that there aren&#8217;t any more rats in a city. I finished it two nights ago and haven&#8217;t been able to stop thinking about the story since. For example, I&#8217;ve been thinking about what I would do if I were in the Siege of Leningrad.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As a white person living in the first world with no discernible problems whatsoever, I often have these situations where I like to test myself by thinking about how good of a job I would do in a time of great mental duress that I have been extremely blessed never to have experienced.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Never mind that the actual times I was under mental duress, during the Israel-Lebanon War in 2006, I completely came unglued and decided that the faulty exhaust on the Number 7 bus stopping under our building in Tel Aviv was really Hezbollah.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  A couple of months ago after reading <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/30057/in-the-attic" target="_blank">Shalom Auslander&#8217;s essay</a>, Mr. B and I discussed what we would do if a second Holocaust happened in America.  This discussion came about because I was saying that I&#8217;m a minimalist and Mr. B challenged me to list the five things we would leave home with and I couldn&#8217;t come up with only five, because I have way more than five books.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;What are you going to pack if the Nazis come,&#8221; Mr. B asked.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Just a couple of things. Toothbrush, toothpaste, and lots of warm clothes.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;That&#8217;s nice.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;You sound condescending.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Yeah, because I&#8217;d bring cash.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;WTF?  What good is cash going to be when you have to escape to, like, Alaska?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be very good because we can exchange it for gold and then exchange it for other goods.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;It&#8217;s not when no one values gold or cash where we&#8217;re going.  Warm clothes on the other hand&#8230;&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;So you&#8217;re going to leave the house with six layers on?  That&#8217;s going to hinder your mobility.  I&#8217;m leaving you behind to the Germans.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;You&#8217;d leave me behind to die?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;That&#8217;s ok, you look goy anyway, so they&#8217;d never take you.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Once Mr. B was done racially profiling me and deciding that I was better off as S.S. cannon fodder than safe and warm in Alaska, I began to trust him less.  Which is why I didn&#8217;t include him in my  siege of Leningrad fantasy survival scenario.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The main character in the <em>Bronze Horseman</em>, Tatiana, survives through her sheer internal fortitude and will to live for another main character, Alexander.  I decided would probably survive by being really strong and murdering people for their bread rations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;You would murder people for food?&#8221; Mr. B asked loudly.  We were sitting at a busy coffee shop in Seattle overlooking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market" target="_blank">Pike Place</a> as we were having this discussion.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Yes.  You don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m capable of. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince" target="_blank">My animal self</a> is much closer to the exterior than it is for other people.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;You would never, ever survive a siege.  You love food too much.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; I paused to lick some of the whipped cream from the top of my iced coffee.  &#8220;But I could get really brutal if push came to shove.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Like how brutal,&#8221; Mr. B asked through his americano, unimpressed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Like Machiavellian-type situations. Like I&#8217;d wait outside the houses of the old and feeble for sweet relief to come and then come take their food.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;You would never last a day in a siege,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;You&#8217;d just get really hungry and complain all the time.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Oh, like you&#8217;d last in a siege.  You&#8217;re too kind and don&#8217;t have a mean bone in your body. You&#8217;d get taken advantage of all the time. Then eaten. By those like me.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;That&#8217;s not true,&#8221; Mr. B said, hurt by this slander of his character. &#8220;I&#8217;d form mutual cooperation societies. Like they do in Hunger Games.  And we&#8217;d roam the streets.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;How would you be doing this?  Shouldn&#8217;t you be at the front fighting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad#Sinyavino_Offensive" target="_blank">Synavino Offensive</a>?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;What, you think they allowed Jews at the front?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Um, <a href="http://www.lettersfront.org/" target="_blank">yes</a>? Also, a lot of <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/10/a-guide-to-trolling-jewish-organizations-featuring-my-grandfather/" target="_blank">my grandfather&#8217;s</a> family served?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Hm.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;But you would be terrible at the front because, you know, you&#8217;re not angry enough. Probably best to try and stick you somewhere in intelligence.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Mr. B and I fell silent and continued to drink our coffee, weighed down by the realization that, despite the fact that we&#8217;ve been told we&#8217;re Russian all our lives, if we were ever put in a country where you have to live on your wits as opposed to a system of established rules, we&#8217;d be done for.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  (except for me. Because, remember, the animal closer to the surface and everything.)
