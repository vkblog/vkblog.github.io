My mom told me this weekend that I [sound](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/08/23/what-is-it-about-analyzing-20-somethings/) [too](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/07/26/what-were-you-doing-instead-of-getting-heat-stroke/) [upbeat](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/06/28/healthcare-and-the-best-of-the-summer/) in my blog, and that it doesn&#8217;t reflect how I am in real life.

So, for the sake of [bloging with integrity](http://www.blogwithintegrity.com/), I am going to reveal that, as you may have surmised by my numerous social media profiles, my blog posts, and pictures of myself in various situations, I am antisocial and I hate small talk. This is a problem for me because the building I live in consists entirety of chipper  organic crunchy granola white people who love small talk like it&#8217;s their job, especially on Monday mornings when I hate the act of living.

I will step on the elevator with my rage face on,[thus](http://vixotic.tumblr.com/post/1025184943/this-us-what-pre-run-at-930-am-on-a-saturday-feels), a natural defense against human contact. However, some friendly woman will not detect it and inevitably will say, &#8220;Oh, I love your necklace.&#8221; As a result, I have to mumble something nice in return, a feat that is, at 7:21 a.m. on a Monday morning, Olympic in nature.

Good People of Arlington. I love you. You are what makes this city. But.  Please, stop talking to me in the elevator.  I don&#8217;t care what you think the weather will be like outside. I have it both on my phone and in my aural/skin receptors once I open the elevator door. I don&#8217;t care about your speculations on the weather for the next week, or about what you did this weekend. If I did, I would ask.

I also don&#8217;t want to tell you what I did this weekend or how I am mentally, physically, and otherwise.  Who do you think you are, Lavrenti Beria?

Generally, I love human contact.  I love people, I love talking to people for a specific purpose, and I love finding out how _my friends_ spent their weekends.  But not you, man in the elevator, not you.
