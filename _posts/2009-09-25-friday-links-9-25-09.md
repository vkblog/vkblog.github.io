This week has been a little crazy in the Boykis household because I am having a hectic month at work, Mr. B is having a hectic time with car repairs, and we just genocided a bunch of ants.  It has been a crazy week in the world, as well.

  1. [Kasparov and Karpov](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8266220.stm) are meeting up again!  By the way, Kasparov is awsome.
  2. [Virginia synagogue serves as mosque](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3778444,00.html) for Ramadan (I&#8217;d love to go see it)
