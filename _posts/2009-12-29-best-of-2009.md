You may notice that I have been putting up very picture-heavy posts to distract you away from the fact that I haven&#8217;t had any content, like some kind of bread and circuses program.  That&#8217;s because I am getting ready for [THE NEW YEAR](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/11/23/whats-the-deal-with-the-russian-new-year-tree/).  You&#8217;ll be seeing some changes (for the better-I hope!) on the blog to make it look a little more solid.

In the meantime, I&#8217;ve compiled a list of some of my favorite blog posts from last  year.

As I was working on my plan for this blog for the next year over a jar or two of Nutella, I realized that my mission always remains the same: to write about what I find fascinating, amazing, and beautiful in the world in hopes that other people find it fascinating and want to talk about it, too.  I do it  in the only way I can write about it-through the lens of someone who has grown up as a semi-outsider in the country that is currently the epicenter of the universe and is torn between at least three different worlds, if not more, and someone who, by profession and education, takes almost everything with a huge grain of salt.

Enjoy!
