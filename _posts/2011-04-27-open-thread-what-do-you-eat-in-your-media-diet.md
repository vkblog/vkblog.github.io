I am really late to this, but _The Atlantic_ has been posting peoples&#8217; [media diets](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/posts/media-diet/) for a while now.  My favorites are the people I&#8217;m most familiar with: [Tyler](https://vkblog.github.io/2009/08/12/book-review-create-your-own-economy-by-tyler-cowen/) [Cowen](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/04/07/is-this-an-econ-talk-or-a-meeting-of-the-xy-chromosome-club/), [Anna Holmes](https://vkblog.github.io/2011/02/15/bye-bye-jezebel/), Terry Gross, [Gary Shteyngart](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/09/14/meeting-the-writer-you-look-up-to-most-is-better-than-mother-theresa-riding-a-unicorn/).

I&#8217;m always interested in what people read and how they read it (which is probably evident by the Friday Links), so I thought it might be fun to share what/how we read stuff in the comments.  What really interests me about the media diet series is how may people use Twitter as a primary news source, how many still are adamant about reading paper versions of newspapers, and how many read New York-centric media.

_Here&#8217;s mine:_

I wake up around 6:30 and turn on Twitter  in Tweetdeck as I eat breakfast. I get the majority of my US breaking news from Twitter, but not this early.  Usually around this time, only Israeli and some European/Russian tweeps are up and at work, so I&#8217;ll catch some stuff from Israel.  I follow a lot of journalists, a lot of economists, and a lot of regular people who are really funny and interesting and sarcastic. I try to be like them.  Then, I flip to my Google News, which is customized with &#8220;Israel&#8221;, &#8220;Russia, &#8221; &#8220;Central Asia,&#8221; &#8220;Economics,&#8221; and &#8220;Global Trade&#8221; sections.  I&#8217;ll skim that for major headlines or trends. Sometimes, I&#8217;ll flip to Google News Russia and Israel and read in Hebrew/Russian.  But only if I&#8217;m feeling unstoppable.

When I get to work, I&#8217;ll open my Google Reader, which I think is my primary source for non-breaking, more in-depth stories, especially esoteric news from Central Asia, Israel, home design, and the world of writers. I spent a long time getting Reader to an efficient way for me to get my news, and that sucker is slick as hell now.   My main go-to reads, according to my Reader Statistics are: [<p style="text-align: center;">

I spent a long time getting Reader to an efficient way for me to get my news, and that sucker is slick as hell now.   My main go-to reads, according to my Reader Statistics are:](http://www.ynetnews.com/home/0,7340,L-3083,00.html) (usually I&#8217;ll read in English but if I&#8217;m feeling super-cocky I&#8217;ll open the Hebrew version), [Apartment Therapy](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/), [ShortFormBlog](http://shortformblog.tumblr.com/), [FastCompany](http://www.fastcompany.com/), [TheRumpus](http://therumpus.net/), and [The Hairpin](http://thehairpin.com/).  I also love [The Tablet](http://www.tabletmag.com/) for Jewish-American centric news. I also catch up with blogs at this point so I can read humor writers who are much more talented than me. I&#8217;m really interested in people who write humor well and those who describe ordinary life well, as well as people living abroad.   Not to mention the [Blog Bloc](https://vkblog.github.io/russian-blogs/)!

Then, I read news from Philly that might impact me locally at [the dismal Philly.com](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/11/29/the-difference-between-washington-and-philly-in-two-screenshots/) and news from my industry, IT consulting. Usually that includes CIO.com and other similar industry mags.

At lunch, I&#8217;ll go through Twitter to see what I missed. Usually that includes a lot of content from NYTimes, The Atlantic, and Russia/Eurasia news.  Since I stopped reading Jezebel, NYMag.com is now my go-to lunch destination, but I feel like I&#8217;m still missing something, and it makes me sad. I stopped reading most feminist blogs entirely because they made me angry and ragey.  I now only read [Curvy Girl Guide](http://www.curvygirlguide.com/).

Halfway through the day, my mom will usually send me what I like to call Angry Israel links from Russian-language Jewish news sources. I will tell her to start reading normal news sources, she will disown me, and this cycle will continue until I tell her we&#8217;ll talk on Skype later.  Sometimes, people send me links I might be interested in via email. Then, sometimes, we have email conversations about those links.  Those are the best.

After work, I try to stop reading news and usually just end up watching something on my computer on Netflix. I hate watching shows at a scheduled time because I feel like the networks think I&#8217;m a moron.  I am working really hard on being away from screens after work and hopefully once we get into home stuff/summer biking weather/5k season, I&#8217;ll be able to achieve it. Once in a while, I&#8217;ll go on Reddit, where the most interesting subreddits for me are [TwoXChromosomes](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/) and [fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/). Never go on the Israel Reddit. Ever.

I am working hard again to start reading paper instead of the computer before bed so I can be relaxed, but the last books I read, The Hunger Games, were on my Kindle for Mac. Next book I&#8217;m buying will be in paper, mark my words.  I try to read at least two books a month, but with the move and going marginally crazy, that hasn&#8217;t happened. Although I do have three books waiting for me when life is semi-back to normal.

On the weekends, I&#8217;ll go to Barnes and Noble to &#8220;browse.&#8221;  I usually leave with something, mostly magazines. Magazines I like to read in print include Snob (it&#8217;s in Russian and at the same reading comprehension level as The Economist so it takes me a really long time to get through it, but so worth it), The Economist, Monocle, Foreign Policy, and The Nest. Also sometimes Rachael Ray Everyday. But don&#8217;t tell anyone. If I feel like I need to impress someone, I&#8217;ll pick up Foreign Affairs or the Harvard Business Review.  If no one&#8217;s watching and Mr. B&#8217;s not with me, I&#8217;ll get Glamour.

I just read this back to myself and realize how much information I consume every day. This includes mostly everything, but is not all-encompassing.   Also, this makes me seem like a huge asshole with lots of free time. But maybe it&#8217;s normal? You tell me.
