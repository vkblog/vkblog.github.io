### <span style="color: #ff6600;">Edit: I was wrong.  I watched it again and she says &#8220;vi&#8221;, so thanks to everyone for pointing it out. Not sure where I got this from.  Maybe from my imagination, which is currently running a Mila vs. Russian journalist kung fu movie?</span>

Everyone has seen the <a href="http://gawker.com/5827142/mila-kunis-chews-out-reporter-in-fluent-russian" target="_blank">Mila Kunis video by now</a>, yes?

Something that I think is interesting that no one is pointing out is that she addressed the reporter as &#8220;ti,&#8221; you, instead of &#8220;vi&#8221;, You.  There are two types of &#8220;You&#8221; in Russian, the formal and the informal. The informal, Ti, is the singular form of &#8220;You&#8221;, and &#8220;Vi&#8221; is the plural form, and the formal form. This is tricky to understand if you don&#8217;t speak Spanish or other languages that have a formal and informal way of addressing people.

Ti is only for people you know, close friends, family, and people your age.  Vi is for people you don&#8217;t know, business, and people older than you.  If you use ti instead of vi, it&#8217;s very insulting. Like, you wouldn&#8217;t call your grandma a bitch, right?  So, well-played Mila?  Or did she just forget the difference?

_Reminder: I&#8217;m liveblogging <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/07/27/the-russian-jersey-shore-no-one-is-ready/" target="_blank">this trainwreck of a show</a> next week.  Just shows you how cool I am:_
