Dear Blog Readers,

I love you.  You are the [rain to my desert.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEzb3yPoCm4) I love you so much that I want you to get as much enjoyment as possible out of my blog.  And since D.C. provides low concentrations of my primary satire material-that is, [Russian Jews](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/01/31/millions-of-babies-the-holocaust-and-gender-segregation-its-the-weekend/) (and really, there&#8217;s only so much I can mock Mr. B since he still peels my oranges for me,) we are moving (back) to Philadelphia.

<!--more-->

Remember [this](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/03/23/a-russian-fairy-tale-tori-and-the-firebird/)?

It&#8217;s been a tough six (seven?) months since then, most of which I have spent wrestling with myself, playing acrobatic mindgames of &#8220;what if this and what if that&#8221; with the Arlington moon  as I-395 outside my window passively hummed by.

This decision was made infinitely harder because now there are two of us impacted by any decision either makes, and even though it&#8217;s a decision we&#8217;ve reached and agreed to mutually, our lives will still be in a mild chaos for the next several months, because, who the hell is going to peel my oranges in Philly? (did I use the word decision enough in that last paragraph?)

There is nothing (except the traffic and [Michaele Salahi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Washington,_D.C.#Michaele_Salahi)) that Mr. B and I don&#8217;t love about D.C. For us, it is the perfect place to live.  It is probably my second-favorite place in the world (aside from the Tel Aviv beach at night.)  We could have sunny breakfasts every weekend, take in the embassies, go see a famous authors, National Book Festivals, dragon boats, meet really cool people, and on and on.

However, we have come to several realizations.

  * The [cost of living](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/moving-cost-of-living-calculator.aspx) is way too high for us to buy a house we&#8217;d like here, especially big enough for expanding our family with [Keeshonds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrcE4Kp3nTU) or having anyone stay over to visit beyond the one-bedroom condo we rent now. The key here is the mean home price difference.

  * <span style="color: #000000; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: none;">The guilt of living far away from family (especially aging grandparents who need to be helped) isn&#8217;t worth balancing out the pleasure we get from living here.</span>
  * If we continue to live the way we do, we will never grow up. It is too convenient and too comfortable to continue to live with minimal responsibilities, sans house, sans Keeshonds, and sans family.
  * It&#8217;s possible to make any city what you want.
  * I am running out of blog material in D.C.

The last one is most critical.

I&#8217;m starting a new technical writing/project management job in Philadelphia in October, which I&#8217;m looking forward to very much because it will be a huge move forward in my career and I get to do more writing (God help us all.)  I am  sad to be leaving the immediate world of economics but, depending on what I decide, I may re-enter it again as a master&#8217;s student.

So, like [<p style="text-align: center;">

So, like ](http://modite.com/blog/2010/09/20/moving-to-a-new-city/) girls my age who [are grappling](http://www.suburbansweetheart.com/2010/09/goodbye-to-everything-that-i-knew.html) with the same type of life changes right now, I am terrified and sad to be leaving friends and Russian-pessimistic and need you to tell me it will all be o.k. in the comments I am excited  as we continue the next chapter.

Luckily, economists believe that everything evens out in the long-run, which is what I&#8217;m gunning for as we move up and out.

P.S. If you live in Philly and read this blog, holla.
