My parents&#8217; house is a  museum to Soviet nostalgia. It&#8217;s  like walking into Miss Havisham&#8217;s house.  Only with Blue Ray and walnut cabinets. Also, Miss Havisham is dead.  Some days, I find books I used to read when I was five that are still copyrighted in the USSR.  Other times, I use the same dishes that were given to them for their wedding.

Yesterday, I was trying to sew a button that had popped off Mr. B&#8217;s pants.  &#8220;Oh, use the thread in my threadbox,&#8221;  my mom remarked to me offhandedly.  This was some of the thread she had available:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2009/06/img_0072.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-472" title="img_0072" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2009/06/img_0072.jpg" alt="img_0072" width="379" height="506" /></a>

  Oh, you can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s written on the spool?

  &#8220;25 KOP&#8221;.  That&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s 25 kopeiek (kopecks).  These spools of thread are from the Brezhnev administration. I should be giving these to an anthropolgist for cultural study  instead of using them for  every day tasks like securing buttons.
