<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Mr. B:</strong></span> \*turns on song\*
  
<span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Me:</strong></span> Is that Prince?  (Mr. B has been into Prince lately)
  
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Mr. B:</strong></span> No.  Listen closer, idiot.
  
**<span style="color: #ff9900;">Me:</span>** \*halfway through the song\* It&#8217;s Prince?
  
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Mr. B:</strong></span> Does that sound like a man to you?
  
The song is [Simply the Best](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIrCFrFpHvw).
  
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Mr. B:</strong> </span> You have problems.
  
<span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Me:</strong></span> What! I can&#8217;t help it that she sounds like a man. I thought that [Modern Talking](http://en.rian.ru/culture/20090422/121250407.html) was women until I was 15 and my parents disillusioned me.
  
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Mr. B:</strong></span> You really do have problems.  *[turns on Modern Talking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kHl4FoK1Ys&playnext=1&videos=2ScQo3uDees&feature=artistob)* Wow.  They really do sound like women.
