Two nights ago marked the start of Hanukah, which is a Jewish holiday that will give me the excuse to tell Mr. B that we probably lost our menorah in the move and, pretty please can I buy a new one. Thank you Maccabees for giving me an excuse to check out [some of these](http://design-milk.com/modern-menorahs/). ([This one is my favorite](http://www.allmodern.com/Moooi-MOABM7-B-MOI1064.html?SSAID=276135&refid=SS276135), and, at only $328, costs only slightly more than my entire wardrobe!) (But wait, [there are more](http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2009/11/201-beautiful-modern-menorahs-for-2009.html). [Two nights ago marked the start of Hanukah, which is a Jewish holiday that will give me the excuse to tell Mr. B that we probably lost our menorah in the move and, pretty please can I buy a new one.

Luckily, I was able to travel to Israel and celebrate there. (ok, so I don&#8217;t know what kind of plane I was traveling on, but it was cheap enough to splice me from the neck down.)
