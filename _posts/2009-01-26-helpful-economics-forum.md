Often when I was an undergrad majoring in economics, and even now, using living, breathing economics as a career, I would often have many questions that the people around me, especially busy professors, sometimes couldn&#8217;t answer.  That&#8217;s why I think it&#8217;s so great that I came across [this site](http://econpoint.com/index.php).  If you are either student or working with econometrics, please contribute to this community and help it grow.

This o[ne looks particularly interesting for me](http://econpoint.com/showthread.php?t=18), but  I highly urge you to take a look if you dabble in Eviews or are curious about r squared.
