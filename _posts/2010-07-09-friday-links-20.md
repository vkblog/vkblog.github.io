Yesterday, Mr.B and I tried Ethiopian food for the first time.  We weren&#8217;t huge fans.

**Me:** But why didn&#8217;t you like it?
  
**Mr. B:** It&#8217;s just&#8230;bleh.  Not filling.  And the [bread](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injera), I&#8217;m not such a huge fan of.
  
**Me:** Maybe it takes some time to get used to it?
  
**Mr. B:** Did it take you a long time to get used to naan or pita?
  
**Mr. B:** That&#8217;s what it is!  Ethiopian food is like Middle Eastern food&#8230;but bad.
