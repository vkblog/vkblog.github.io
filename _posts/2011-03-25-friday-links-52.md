Did you know that I am now part of a [Blog Bloc](http://likethevodka.com/?p=3113)?  It&#8217;s part of my effort to better organize the Russian/Jewish content on my site.  You can find [a list of bloggers here](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/russian-blogs/) and a badge if you are such a blogger and want one.  But don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll still write about [Nutella](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/10/27/midnight-nutella-a-halloween-post/), how much [my family is afraid of third world countries](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/03/08/a-conversation-with-my-parents-about-india/), and [various girlcrushes,](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/03/07/dambisa-moyo-my-girlcrush-in-philly/) too.

By the way,

I am part of a Russian-American Professional group on LinkedIN. One of the recent discussions has been &#8220;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/e/1hhm2h-glnr2j62-3r/vaq/15335780/40692/34859307/view_disc/" target="_blank">Why is it SO difficult (in most cases) to do business with Russian-Americans?</a>&#8221;  The answers to the question are hilarious, because it is mostly true that it is difficult to do business with Russian-Americans, especially if they are very recent immigrants.  Here&#8217;s part of the thread that I enjoyed:
