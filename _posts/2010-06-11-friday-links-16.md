Thanks to everyone for your running encouragement.   I didn&#8217;t expect any, especially since I&#8217;m too lazy to encourage myself.  Yesterday, Mr. B and I [went to see Christopher Hitchens](http://twitter.com/vboykis/status/15919516460), and [I ran/limped 3.6 miles to the event](http://twitter.com/vboykis/status/15846685587) from work ([my motivation being fatty food](http://twitter.com/vboykis/status/15881684328)) and I&#8217;m still recovering.  Happy weekend.
