Chaviva is [getting married](http://www.kvetchingeditor.com/2010/05/today-im-getting-hitched.html) today.  This is a big deal, for a number of reasons, including the fact that she has been undergoing an arduous journey in converting to Judaism, one that finally came full circle several months ago with her Orthodox conversion.

As  a fellow Jew and one that has been married for almost two years, I feel completely qualified to give marriage advice. This whole episode is making me extremely sentimental remembering our own Jewish wedding which satisfied almost none of the [requirements of a Jewish wedding and](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_wedding) only some of the requirements of a [Russian wedding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_wedding).

But, regardless, I think we&#8217;ve had a pretty solid marriage so far.

  So, here are my tips for marriage to newlyweds.
</p>

  1.](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/04/15/mr-bs-minimalism/) If you can&#8217;t compromise, wait it out.  Then throw it away.
  2. [Build a home together.](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/04/14/welcome-to-the-bardak-that-is-my-apartment/) Then destroy it and become minimalist.
  3. Go to [experiences that unite you](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/01/31/millions-of-babies-the-holocaust-and-gender-segregation-its-the-weekend/).
  4. Go to [experiences that may make you parapalegic](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/01/18/riding-a-horse-is-like-blogging-except-you-cant-become-a-parapalegic-if-you-blog/).
  5. [Marry Russian](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/07/30/the-pros-of-russian-husbands/).
  6. Maintain [sanity in the household](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/02/18/shlom-bayit-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9D-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA-maintaining-sanity-and-comparative-advantage-in-the-household/).
  7. And [screw yourself over](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/01/27/changing-my-last-name-or-how-i-totally-screwed-over-feminism/) every once in a while.

Mazal tov to the newlyweds.
