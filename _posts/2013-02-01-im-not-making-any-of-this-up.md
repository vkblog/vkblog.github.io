<p style="padding-left: 60px;">
   -My hero, Dave Barry, last night at the Philadelphia Free Library.
</p>

I first started reading Dave Barr&#8217;s syndicated column when we got the [Patriot-News](http://www.thepamediagroup.com/) delivered on Sundays back when people still go the news delivered. I was maybe 8?  Everything he wrote, I thought was hilarious, even though I didn&#8217;t understand some things he wrote,  and I wanted to write funny things just like him.

He is one of the first people that made me laugh out loud when he wrote things.

Wikipedia says,

> Barry has defined a sense of humor as &#8220;a measurement of the extent to which we realize that we are trapped in a world almost totally devoid of reason. Laughter is how we express the anxiety we feel at this knowledge.&#8221;

Almost everything you need to know <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_middlebrow/2005/01/dave_barry.html" target="_blank">is here</a>:

> Barry&#8217;s editors dispatched their man to New York to give the _Times _its comeuppance. Barry returned with a wicked 4,000-word <a href="http://www.davebarry.com/gg/newyork.html" target="_blank" data-linktype="External">story</a> in which he gently pointed out that Ed Koch&#8217;s Manhattan was a carnival of urban decay and drug paraphernalia, too. Where the _Times_&#8216; story__had been heavy-handed and sober, Barry was impish and hilarious, reporting, &#8220;[W]e immediately detect signs of a healthy economy in the form of people squatting on the sidewalk selling realistic jewelry.&#8221; The denizens of Times Square, he observed, were &#8220;very friendly, often coming right up and offering to engage in acts of leisure with you.&#8221;

Dave Barry is an American treasure and helped make me Who I Am As A Writer (which would be an excellent name for a band). I am so privileged to have seen him live.
