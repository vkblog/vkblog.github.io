Mr. B and I were driving to Sam&#8217;s Club yesterday because we&#8217;re having some (upwards of 40) people over on Saturday and we needed ginormous-sized portions of everything.

This is a conversation we had in the car, which is a pretty typical conversation for us.

Mr. B: Did you watch [that link I sent you](http://wearemany.org/v/case-for-withdrawal-from-afghanistan)?
  
Me: No, because it has Noam Chomsky in it and you know he gives me spasms.
  
Mr. B: But [Malalai Joya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malalai_Joya) was in it.  I thought you might be interested in that part.
  
Me: Nah. But speaking of Afghanistan, I started reading this really really cool blog, it&#8217;s called [Jalalagood](http://www.jalalagood.com/). You know, like Jalalabad?
  
Mr. B: Yeah, yeah.  Pretty clever.
  
Me: Its tagline is &#8220;Adventures in [Khyber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pass)space.&#8221; KHYBERSPACE. It kills me.
  
Mr. B: &#8230;.
  
Me: Anyway, so one of the posts is about this thing they have in Afghanistan, [buzgashi](http://www.jalalagood.com/2011/03/buzkashi/), which is basically like polo on horses, except instead of a ball there&#8217;s a dead goat.
  
Mr. B: What the hell?
  
Me: Yeah, apparently it&#8217;s all the rage.
  
Mr. B: That is some f-ed up shit. Where would you have a dead goat lying around? Can you imagine?
  
Me: I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s pretty common in Afghanistan. Like, they don&#8217;t have too many balls over there.
  
Mr. B: Yeah, but can you imagine a scenario where you&#8217;re like, oh, we don&#8217;t have any balls, let&#8217;s use a dead goat?
  
Me:  Maybe the goat died of disease and they can use it instead of eating it.
  
Mr. B: Oh.  So they&#8217;re playing with a goat that had, like, rabies?
  
Me: Not rabies, but like it was diseased enough not to eat, and they&#8217;re not letting it go to waste.
  
Mr. B: That&#8217;s messed up.
  
Me: Did you know there&#8217;s also [yak polo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/asb353/4029465798/)? That&#8217;s my life goal.
  
Mr. B: That&#8217;s because you have Mongolian blood.  You know how I know?  You&#8217;re short, angry, Machiavellian, and you always want to travel somewhere.

Soon after, we arrived at Sam&#8217;s Club, and we pretty much had sensory overload, because holy hell. What&#8217;s interesting about Sam&#8217;s Club is that the portions are HUGE, and so are the shoppers.

Look at this jar of pickles we bought:

If we ate all the pickles in this jar, we would have enough room to fit a baby in there, [Brave New World-style](http://www.huxley.net/bnw/one.html).  Or maybe a goat.
