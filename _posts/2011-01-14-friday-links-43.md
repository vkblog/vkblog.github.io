My plans this weekend:  Sleeping. Begging Mr. B to schlep to the city to [take me to any of these places](http://www.phillymag.com/restaurants/the_philly_mag_50/index.html).  [Finishing this book](http://www.amazon.com/Possessed-Adventures-Russian-Books-People/dp/0374532184).    And you?

Firstly, If you haven&#8217;t yet, go over to Marinka&#8217;s blog, where [I wrote a guest post](http://www.motherhoodinnyc.com/i-got-your-blood-libel-right-here) and her dad has some great Jewish recipe tips!

Secondly, here are the links:

  1. [How do you choose](http://nation-branding.info/2010/12/29/naming-a-nation-southern-sudan/) a name for a country?
  2. How [I learned to keep worrying](http://www.thesmartset.com/article/article01071102.aspx).
  3. On [resolutions](http://nothingbutbonfires.com/2011/01/tomorrow-we-will-run-faster).
