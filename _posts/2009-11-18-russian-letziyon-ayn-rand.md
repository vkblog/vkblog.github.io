I think it&#8217;s really been a while since we&#8217;ve had a comic.  I promise to get back into normal comic-ing schedule once this insanity (NaNoWriMo) is over and I can have my life back.  In the meantime, enjoy.  I know it&#8217;s not the best. As in, you couldn&#8217;t pay me to look at it. But Michael is about to get sunburned and I totally needed to focus on that.

The comic is based on all the hype that&#8217;s been [going around](http://www.politico.com/click/stories/0911/rand_goes_mainstream.html) about [Ayn Rand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand) lately, particularly two new books that have been written about her, one about her [connection to economic thought](http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/rand_y_for_capitalism/Content?oid=1186358) and the other [about her personal life](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/11/01/RVSR1AART9.DTL), (here&#8217;s another take, by the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/books/22rand.html?bl)) in which she was just as unhinged as I will be after I&#8217;m done with The Novel.

I was so excited to read her in 8th grade (for the record, I did finish The Fountainhead, but then promptly slit my writsts for my own good afterwards so I&#8217;d never have to pick up one of her books again.) I waded through the book like a fisherman wades through a creek filled with pirhanas.  I was fascinated by Howard Roark, by his obsessive quest to remain alone and by the buildings he erected, just by looking at them with his steely blue eyes.  I didn&#8217;t come away a Randite, but I was curious as to what kind of woman would be able to pull off writing such a book, and I researched her a bit.

And then promptly lost all respect for her when I found out she covered up her Russian Jewish identity, cheated on her husband with one of her &#8220;disciples&#8221; and was hopped up on [methamphetamines](http://althouse.blogspot.com/2009/10/ayn-rand-kept-going-on-amphetamines-and.html) to write.
