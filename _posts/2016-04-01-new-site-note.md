title: Technical note: New site!
--

Hi! It's been a while. A couple months, in fact.

Part of it has been that I've been crazy-busy with: 

A) Finishing up my MBA. 

B) Starting a new job and studying for some certifications for that new job


C) Baby! (Now toddler!)

and

D) Feeling blocked because of my writing environment.  

I've loved Wordpress for a very long time. Since I got started blogging in 2009, in fact.  For all of that time, 
Wordpress allowed me to publish quickly without worrying about the back-end details, namely since Mr. B handled 
a lot of that for me. It's an extremely important tool for the Internet, 
I still 100% recommend it to anyone looking to get into writing online. 

But,over the past four years, two things happened at the same time: Wordpress started getting harder and harder to maintain
and held a lot less joy, and the longer I worked in tech, the more I appreciated version control and static pages, 
two tools that help keep track of changes in both code and writing drafts
a little better than Wordpress's current system.  I also started really hating how bloated Wordpress was
and how it always made me update stuff. 

Additionally, I started getting some heavy traffic from viral posts that made my server
keel over and die, which in turn made me question the regular uptime of the site, and I worried
that whenver I tweeted out a link to my blog, my site wouldn't be there, frustrating the reader. 
I also felt my site getting slower and slower with all of the Wordpress overhead. 

So, every time I tried to start a new post, I felt blocked by the Wordpress environment and the
thought that it wouldn't be a good user experience, and I'd get writer's block. 

I've switched to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).  Although it is [harder to set up](http://veekaybee.github.io/static-sites-suck/),  is a lot nicer than Wordpress in a lot of ways, the most
important of which is portability of writing, something that's important for any writer. It is also a lot more stable, 
especially since the version I'm running is backed up by [GitPages](https://pages.github.com/). 

The tradeoff that the migration from Wordpress has been keeping me up much more than the baby for the past couple months. 

Namely, here are the things I'm still working on: 

+ Adding back comments (migrating to/from Disqus and integrating into Jekyll is annoying)
+ Links to XML feeds
+ Getting back to blogging at a regular cadence !

But if I don't release this site now, I'm going to go insane. So, here it is, warts and all.
