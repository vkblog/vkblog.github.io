Translation:

> The Christmas holiday turns us to the roots of our spiritual traditions, to the Christian ideals of high morality and charity. They have for centuries served as the major value orientation for the people, the foundation of social life in Russia. And today, they help to strengthen the moral fabric of society, to maintain an atmosphere of mutual respect, tolerance and harmony.
> 
> These goals, common for everyone &#8211; the preservation of civil peace in the country and the development of interfaiths dialogue &#8211; are a joint activity of the state and the Russian Orthodox Church. And of course &#8211; on the education of the younger generation in the spirit of true patriotism and respect for family values.
> 
> Christmas &#8211; a time of good intentions and deeds. Let the light of this holiday always accompany you, give confidence, gives joy and hope.

It sounds like something out of an Obama/Bush speech, doesn&#8217;t it?

Hooray!  Our country is broken, but Merry Christmas anyway!
