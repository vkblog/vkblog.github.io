Please brace yourselves for a very sad picture that is the opposite of Cribs.

This is what happens when you have two people living together, one of which is busy with product launches at work, homework at school, and writing a book in the 4 minutes she has left over in the day, and the other of which mostly forgets to eat three meals a day.

&#8220;Feed me!&#8221; the fridge is crying in despair.

&#8220;We are so lonely!&#8221; say the yogurts.

&#8220;Maybe later,&#8221; say the fridge owners.

On the other hand, when you actually do go grocery shopping, you don&#8217;t always put them away. Sometimes strange things happen at the house. Like matzah in the living room, like a piece of abstract art.
