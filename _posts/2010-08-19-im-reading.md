  Reviews for all three to come soon, after this insanity that is<a href="https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?id=278"> SAS Level II Programming</a> stops taking over my life and I turn back rightside up.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;ve been having a really hard time reviewing <em>Super Sad True Love Story</em> because it has so many dimensions and angles that I just can&#8217;t tackle it without sounding like I gushingly approve of everything Shteyngart wrote and sounding like every other review out there, from Slate, to NY Times, to Salon, etc.  However, this book is brilliant, ridiculously black-humor hilarious, and hits too close to home on too many fronts.

  The Mongolia book is amazing.  I never knew much about Mongolia other than the fact that Mr. B teases me that I must be Mongol (because my dad has suspicion his side of the family actually is) and always telling me to go ride a horse.  There is so much history between Russia and China in Mongolia that it&#8217;s insane that this country, on the strategic border of both, never gets any notice in the news.  In two chapters, I learned more than I ever had about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Ungern_von_Sternberg">crazy-ass people</a> that tried to invade and rule Mongolia, as well as Mongolian religion and mentality. It&#8217;s more than just yurts, people.

  The Nest.  Well.  I love reading the website because it&#8217;s full of married life-type advice from people in the know.  The magazine is amazing because it gives me insight into what advertisers think yuppies like (hint: cute, sleek teapots that cost $50) and how they are already preparing people that have been married for 1+ years for parenthood by telling them all the allergies they could possibly pass on to their child (panic now!)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Let&#8217;s see? How much does a baby really cost??  $30,000 a year, according to The Nest.  I mean, I guess if the baby lays golden eggs, sure.
