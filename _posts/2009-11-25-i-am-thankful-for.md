being done with my novel!

I closed in yesterday with 50,035 words and am taking a major break. Towards the end, it was really bad.  But your support helped me out so much, and I want to thank you for answering my questions and commenting on my blog posts, which is part of what kept me going and kept me semi-sane.

All&#8217;s well that ends well in the novel.  But now comes the hard part-editing.  Anyone know any literary agents that would be interested in a semi-chaotic attempt to satirize Russian Jewish life? <img src="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Also, Happy Thanksgiving.
