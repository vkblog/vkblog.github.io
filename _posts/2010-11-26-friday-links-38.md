Because I am fat and lazy and it&#8217;s post-Thanksgiving, we&#8217;re going to try some freestyle today, in the writing style of T[he Awl](http://www.theawl.com/) and [the Hairpin](http://thehairpin.com/).

I can&#8217;t believe this show exists:

I think [this article is full of whine](http://www.newsweek.com/2010/11/22/what-food-says-about-class-in-america.html) but I&#8217;m too lazy to write about why I think the author is really reaching and makes some wrong analogies and interprets some statistical findings incorrectly and uses journalistic hyperbole as linkbait.

Were you agonizing over what to get me for Hannukah or nondenominational New Year or the Orthodox Christmas?  [<p style="text-align: center;">

[Haters gonna hate Nicki Minaj](http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/11/nicki_minaj_and_rihanna.html?imw=Y&f=most-viewed-24h5) and feminists will try to see a feminism that isn&#8217;t there but I do enjoy the dress.

I am not embarrassed to admit that [I&#8217;ve loved Subliminal](http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/music/51141/message/) since I heard him the first time on a 10:35 PM flight from Warsaw to Tel Aviv and had no clue what he was singing but I knew it was Hebrew rap so it must be awesome. Also he has a song where the chorus is, &#8220;Hip hop b&#8217;ivrit, it&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;

Are [affluents really $100,000 and up](http://www.mint.com/blog/trends/couples-and-money-11092010/?display=wide)? And do they really wear monocles?

Where can I get my hands on a copy of [Hickey&#8217;s Bengal Gazette](http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/english-through-the-ages)?

[Where are these textbooks](http://therumpus.net/2010/11/an-artists-interpretation-of-a-teenagers-head-exploding-in-science-class/) and can I get some along with the halucinogen sample that comes with them?

Do you love being cheap at TJMaxx as much as I do? [<p style="text-align: center;">

[This video is fantastic and it blew my mind,](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2010/11/migrant-worker-human-rights-lebanon-video-satire.html) namely because of the switch-a-roo situation, but also because WHEN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN FILIPINOS AND SRI LANKANS TALKING TO EACH OTHER IN LEBANESE ARABIC?

There is economics [in everything](http://shamaniceconomist.blogspot.com/2010/11/diy-holiday.html) (evil laughter.)

[Sexytimes in 1580something](http://www.harpyness.com/2010/11/20/poetry-saturdays-john-donne/) (surprisingly safe for work and/or English PhDs.)

[But&#8230;but..but Thomas Friedman](http://therumpus.net/2010/11/dont-let-this-happen-to-you-7/)!
