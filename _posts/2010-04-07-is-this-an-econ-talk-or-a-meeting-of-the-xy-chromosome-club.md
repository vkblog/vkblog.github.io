So, yesterday, Mr. B and I went to George Washington University (Motto:s[o that&#8217;s what a $60,000-a-year cafeteria looks like](http://money.cnn.com/popups/2006/news/expensive_colleges/index.html)!) to hear one of my favorite economists, Dr.  [Tyler Cowen](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/) talk on a number of topics.  You may recall that [[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2714" title="DSC03112" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/04/DSC03112.png" alt="" width="700" height="996" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/04/DSC03112.png)

What really intrigued me the most, though, was the audience breakdown of his lecture.  Given that it was on a college campus, I did expect a lot of people to be students, and given that it was sponsored by the Local Libertarians, I did expect a lot of it to be guys.  But the amount of women in the room was extremely surprising:

I&#8217;m wondering why the amount of females was so small?  And what does this say about the Internet as a whole? More importantly, what does it say about me that I&#8217;m willing to skip out on Happy Hour to listen to explanations of the financial crisis?
