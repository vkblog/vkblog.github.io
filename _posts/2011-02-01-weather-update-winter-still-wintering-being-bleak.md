Let me set the scene for you.

6:58 in the morning. I am bleary and driving to work, listening to the radio:

    , but not bad enough that I don&#8217;t feel comfortable driving.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    The phone rings.  It&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/06/21/happy-fathers-day/">my dad</a>.  Frankly, I&#8217;m surprised he called so late, because usually he calls me at 6:15 am and then again at 6:32.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    &#8220;Are you going to work today?&#8221;<br /> &#8220;Yes, why?&#8221;<br /> &#8220;It&#8217;s supposed to be freezing raining and sleeting.  It is here.  Don&#8217;t go to work.&#8221;<br /> &#8220;It&#8217;s not that bad and I have to go to work.&#8221;<br /> &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget, your mom got into a car accident in weather conditions EERILY SIMILAR to the ones now.&#8221;<br /> &#8220;What do you think is more likely, me getting into a car accident because of one inch of freezing rain, or me getting into a car accident because you tend to call me when I&#8217;m driving to work?&#8221;<br /> *long thoughtful pause*<br /> &#8220;I&#8217;ll be ok, I promise.&#8221;<br /> *Dad hangs up*
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    But I bet he&#8217;ll call me again at 5:45 when I&#8217;m driving home.
