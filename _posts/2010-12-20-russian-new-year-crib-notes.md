I&#8217;ve been at quite a few holiday parties over the past couple weeks (ok, two. I just wanted to sound socialetist) and every single time (since the majority of the people at the parties have been American) have had to explain how I&#8217;m Jewish and celebrate Haunkkah but at the same time, New Year&#8217;s is the really big holiday for me.  I wish I could just show them [this blog post from last year](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/11/23/whats-the-deal-with-the-russian-new-year-tree/) explaining the whole [Russian New Year](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/11/23/monday-photo-blues/) situation.  Maybe I can make business cards about it?

Although my tree is somewhere deep in Mr. B&#8217;s mom&#8217;s basement and my New Year plans are uncertain as we speak, I&#8217;m still indulging in the New Year spirit through Youtube and through [this picture](http://500px.com/photo/264919), which I can&#8217;t take credit for at all. .
