Thanksgiving &#8211; a strictly American meal
  
With apples to cobbler and squashes to peel
  
With green beans and pudding and  fancy red wines
  
With unpronounceable things like aubergines

Thanksgiving done thus is a Russian kid&#8217;s dream
  
But in floats [holodetz](http://www.grouprecipes.com/37724/holodetz---russian-jellied-beef.html),  and you want to scream.
  
Instead of  the stuffing and biscuts and pie
  
Surprise! It&#8217;s [olivi](http://www.abigslice.com/salat.html)ye and you want to cry.

What&#8217;s that on the plate?! Is it penne ala vodka??
  
Oh no, God forbid, it&#8217;s [selyodka](http://windowstorussia.com/recipe-from-russia-selyodka-pod-shuboy_07.html).
  
And how about a nice filled-with-olives platter?
  
Nope! Just some chicken liver, dripping with batter.

You&#8217;d think eating your own ethnic food is rewarding,
  
But a girl can only take so much vodkaboarding.
  
So this year, she&#8217;s taking control of the reins.
  
She&#8217;s cooking ALL side dishes, right down to le pain.

She&#8217;s making some [beans with some cute yellow rice](http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/cuban-style-yellow-rice/Detail.aspx)
  
She&#8217;s making some dishes with more than one spice
  
She&#8217;s making some corn and potatoes-WITH FLAIR
  
There might even be a NUTELLA ECLAIR.

And yet, as she gathers her [garam masala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garam_masala)
  
She knows with a heavy heart what will follow.
  
As she takes tumeric, tofu, and brownies to bake
  
The women will ask, &#8221; What the hell did you make??&#8221;

&#8220;Where is our [sheika](http://www.russianfood.com/recipes/recipe.php?rid=47381) and borscht and our life?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Tofu for a man?? Are you really a wife??&#8221;
  
&#8220;Where&#8217;s the meat, the boiled cabbage, the damn [pirozhki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirozhki)?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Bring back the food, or you&#8217;re off to Luzhki. &#8221;

And, because the best defense&#8217;s offense,
  
She&#8217;ll come back to them, &#8220;Oh elders, why so intense?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Poor little old me is without my man-
  
He&#8217;s as far away as at least Pakistan
  
I have not a house, I have not a home
  
I have not a pot, nor even a bone.
  
It&#8217;s not that I want to deprive you of  crap-I mean-food
  
It&#8217;s just that right now I can&#8217;t do it so good.
  
Please come to my house next year-I will host!
  
There&#8217;ll be sheika and [bliny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blintz) and even a toast
  
A toast to you ladies-you fabulous dames
  
Without whom Thanksgiving would not be the same
  
But for now please accept my humble (tofu) pie*
  
Do you want your favorite daughter/niece/cousin to cry? &#8221;

They&#8217;ll look at her and munch quietly, forgiving.
  
And that&#8217;s how Jew guilt, every time, wins Thanksgiving.

The author of this poem is thankful for everything, despite the facts coming across differently on her kvetchblog. Here&#8217;s hoping you have a safe and happy holiday and if you are outside of the United States, a nice Thursday. And pray for me and my cooking &#8220;skills.&#8221;

*I am not actually making a tofu pie.
