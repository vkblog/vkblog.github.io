This coming Monday, April 16, is the anniversary of the Battle of Culloden, a brutal and horrifying battle in which thousands of men died and Scotland lost its independence once and for all.

It&#8217;s also the day I&#8217;m releasing my ebook! (about our trip to Scotland)

Hopefully.Â If Amazon cooperates.

You know how Russian pessimist I can be about these things.

So, probably expect it like, next month.

So, stay tuned.

I am so, so, so excited to share it with you.
