Heppy Fort ov Dzhuly is what I wish people when I feel like being ironic and sport my FOB accent.

But if there wasn&#8217;t a Fort ov Dzhuly, I wouldn&#8217;t have my ironic accent. Or my [ironic keffyieh shirt](http://www.jewlicious.com/2009/06/keffiyeh-irony-t-shirt/).  Or an American education, American job, or American anything. I&#8217;d probably just be sitting in Russia.  I&#8217;d probably have a going-nowhere job and come home to tons of housework every night in my miniscule apartment that was 40 or 50 years old but still cost $80,000 or $100,000 ,which would take me about 30-40 years to accumulate on my average salary of $12,000.  On the weekends, I&#8217;d watch Friends in Russian.  Then I&#8217;d do it all again the next week.  Maybe I&#8217;d have a small business, and then the mafia would come by and take some money every week to make sure I stayed in business.

If there was no Fort ov Dzhuly, Mr. B would be drafted into the Russian Army and beaten every couple days or so for dedovschina, hazing induction into the Russian army .  Probably more so because he&#8217;s Jewish and Russians aren&#8217;t big fans of Jews in the army (or anywhere.)  He might have risen to the top with his programming skills, as he has here. But it&#8217;s hard to break through unless you have a lot of money to bribe people.  Talent isn&#8217;t recognized very well in Russia.

    Instead of being beaten senseless, Mr. B is seen here, frolicking. Yay!

Most of this is, of course,  owed more to our parents&#8217; initiative than the creation of America, but what I&#8217;m saying is that, for immigrants, America is a godsend.  And I am grateful.  Thanks, [TJ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson), [G-Dub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington), [Alex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton), and [Ben](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin) and the rest.  In honor, here&#8217;s a song from 1776, one of my favorite musicals.
