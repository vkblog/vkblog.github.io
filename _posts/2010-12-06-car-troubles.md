I&#8217;m writing this morning&#8217;s post from an exotic location that has become extremely familiar to me and one I hope to never have to visit again: a car dealership.

<p style="text-align: center;">

In a spate of luck which I can only describe as Vickensian, Mr. B&#8217;s three-year old and extremely reliable Civic has started having issues that need to be checked out the same weekend that we finally started to look for a new car to replace my 11-year-old Accord.

In a spate of luck which I can only attribute as God messing with me, Mr. B poorly planned ahead (as polite a euphemism as I could come up with without coming across like, &#8220;What, I don&#8217;t have enough to worry about, now this shit?&#8221;) and now he has my car and I have his and I have to take his to the dealership, get picked up by Mr. B&#8217;s mom, take her car to work as she carpools, and share one car with her until Mr. B&#8217;s car problems are resolved.  And then, once his car is repaired, I have to drive to to D.C. and switch cars with him.  AND THEN I have to drive up bright and early on Christmas Eve to my parents&#8217; house so I can get my annual inspection for MY car AND get some issues wherein fixed.  and then. and then.  I have to buy a new car, an experience which is possibly more painful than all of the aforementioned.

Or, as I put it on Facebook:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3997" title="Screen shot 2010-12-06 at 7.43.35 AM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-06-at-7.43.35-AM.png" alt="" width="746" height="89" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-06-at-7.43.35-AM.png)

This problem would be solved entirely if dealerships did the repairs we needed on weekends (or peoples&#8217; internal planning calendars worked more than 24 hours ahead), but, alas! God forbid someone make more money.

So now, I am at the dealership anxiously chugging on my water bottle  because I&#8217;m going to be late for work and although I don&#8217;t have any urgent meetings this morning, much like an 85-year-old woman living for the early bird special in Boca Raton, I HATE deviating from my schedule and, what&#8217;s more, I HATE inconveniencing Mr. B&#8217;s mom (who, I have figured out, is a saint) and just generally having other people rearrange their lives for me.

Is it [the future](http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-10/future-public-transportation-involves-personal-helicopters-mag-lev-cars-and-zeppelins) yet?
