  * Having a pane of Soviet-grade glass fall on my head when I was 3
  * Getting lost in my neighborhood in the dark when I was 8 and coming home, crying, to have my mom lecture me about rapists. Of course, there is no such thing as sex in Russia, so it wasn&#8217;t really rapists, but &#8220;Bad People.&#8221;
  * Getting into a near-fatal car accident with Mr. B. We were both unharmed, the car was totalled.
  * Working an internship in <a href="http://vkorchagin.blogspot.com/2006/07/sushi-rivers-and-suicide-bombers.html" target="_blank">a country that went to war</a>.  I was at the beach.
  * Same country.  <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/09/16/gods-is-straight-up-messing-with-me/" target="_blank">God screws me over</a>.
  * Falling off a horse getting ready to go into a gallop.
  * Going to <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/06/29/i-almost-died-for-a-250-discount-on-an-ikea-chair/" target="_blank">West Philadelphia</a>.
  * <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/02/07/im-still-alive-from-snowmageddon/" target="_blank">Snowmageddon</a>.
  * Experiencing a 5.8-level earthquake on the second day that I chose to work in a <a href="http://www.topofthetower.com/" target="_blank">50-story building</a>, on floor 42. If you&#8217;ve never experienced an earthquake that high up, it feels like all your paranoia and Russian pessimism have finally been justified.
