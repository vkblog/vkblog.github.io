I figured everyone would be tired of all the NaNoWriMo reporting, so here are a couple pictures from my home city of Yaroslavl, from of [nohobot on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nohobotic/sets/72157606272098632/).  I hope you don&#8217;t mind me using these, because [they are gorgeous and evoke a definite sense of longing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/nohobotic/sets/72157606272098632/). The NaNoWriMo Day 4 post is below.
