After seeing this commercial:
  


&nbsp;

&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they ever show women buying men jewelry and having the jewelry face?&#8221;
  


&#8220;Are you serious?&#8221;
  
&#8220;What?&#8221;
  
&#8220;That&#8217;s the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard?&#8221;
  
&#8220;But why? If more ads showed women buying men jewelry, it would become more acceptable? What if I bought you jewelry?&#8221;
  
\*crazy stare\* &#8220;No.&#8221;
  
&#8220;What if I bought you a man ring?&#8221;
  

  
&#8220;Still no.  I don&#8217;t even like to wear my wedding ring.&#8221;
  
&#8220;What about a necklace?  Like a chain?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Like  the Russian mafia?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Point taken.&#8221;

Sorry, Zales.  You&#8217;re not getting our sales this year, for Mr. B.  Also, myself.  Probably due to the fact that I have, no joke, lost 75% of the jewelry that I&#8217;ve been gifted, including my own wedding ring.  For my 14th birthday, my dad got me a necklace and I cried and asked him to buy me a good hardcover atlas of the world instead.  I still use that atlas.  Commercial me that, bling industry.
