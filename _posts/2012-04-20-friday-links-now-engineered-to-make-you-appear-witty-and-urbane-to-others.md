Can I just gloat for a second that the <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552564" target="_blank">most-read article in The Economist this week</a> was on my beloved Shotlandia (which would be an excellent name for a vodka, by the way)? So if you are buying <a href="http://ebook.vickiboykis.com/" target="_blank">my book</a>, which contains a brief but maybe kind of inaccurate history of the issue, you will be all the hotness at your suave cocktail parties this year as you wow people with your expertise.

&#8220;Did you know, Mittsy,&#8221; you&#8217;ll say to  your fellow chatterer holding an appletini, &#8220;did you know, Mittsy, that Scotland has been trying to become independent for the last three hundred years and that its future now lies in hydroelectric energy? &#8221;

&#8220;Really,&#8221; Mittsy will say and adjust her Lilly Pulitzer purse.

&#8220;Oh, yes, quite,&#8221; you&#8217;ll say.  &#8220;Did you also know that people almost get shanked there on a regular basis?&#8221;

&#8220;What,&#8221; Mittsy will choke on her olive.

&#8220;According to Vicki Boykis, it&#8217;s true,&#8221; you&#8217;ll say smugly.  &#8220;If it&#8217;s in a self-published book being advertised on a blog read by four people, two of whom are the author and her husband, it must be 100% legit.&#8221;
