  <strong>My secret links:</strong>
</p>

  1. [STILL worried](http://design-milk.com/jerusalem-pendant-by-knockoutdesign/) about what you are getting me for the holidays?
  2. My friend Matt said [of this link](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/fashion/09bartenders.html?_r=3), &#8220;This is why white people should not be allowed to  own property.&#8221;

  3.](http://ajourneyroundmyskull.blogspot.com/2010/12/illustrating-agony-in-eight-fits.html) the Hunting of the Snark!
  4. [As I read this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/eiynl/how_much_money_do_you_save_in_your_twenties/), Veuve Clicquot glass in hand, monocle on, and lounging on pure kangaroo leather, I laugh and laugh.
  5. The [only good thing about Russia](http://englishrussia.com/index.php/2010/12/09/google-with-russian-flavor/). Except St. Petersburg. Also [shproti](http://www.russianfoodmalta.com/sunshop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=75).
  6. [Oh look.](http://www.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Books/Article.aspx?ID=197982&R=R1) An Israeli novel that would be perfect for the Israeli novel reader on your gift list.
  7. [What really gets me is the silver color](http://daddytypes.com/2010/12/04/i_even_made_a_film_about_ironing_once_and_this_is_depressing.php), representing a bleak life of druggery.  Happy Birthday, Hannah! You&#8217;re going to iron.
  8. My God, it&#8217;s like [Liz Coleville is just right inside](http://thehairpin.com/2010/12/be-prepared-for-hypothetical-horrific-things-by-always-thinking-about-them/) my brain.  Right there.
  9. Meanwhile, [in Russia](http://moscowdailyshot.blogspot.com/2010/12/hanukkah.html).
 10. Basically this whole list of links is j[ust a subtle ploy](http://design-milk.com/helvetica-hanger/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+design-milk+%28Design+Milk%29) to get you to buy me things I don&#8217;t need.
 11. [Data analysis is the future of journalism](http://flowingdata.com/2010/12/08/data-analysis-is-the-future-of-journalism/), which means if you became an English major because you, like me, hate integrals, we&#8217;re all screwed.
 12. &#8220;I&#8217;m [prettier in Israel](http://emilylhauserinmyhead.wordpress.com/2010/12/08/dont-know-the-steps-cant-hear-the-music/).&#8221;
