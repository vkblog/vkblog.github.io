This is where I&#8217;ve been sitting a lot this weekend:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2011/09/IMAG0952.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5715" title="IMAG0952" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2011/09/IMAG0952.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="461" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  and doing homework.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Homework is infuriatingly hard.  Basically, none of the stuff in the textbook makes sense to me because I never had Calc II, which they assume you know.  So I&#8217;ll try to start solving a problem, see that there is no help to be had in my notes, read the textbook, read the second textbook, read the third textbook, and, as they say in Russian, <em>smotret v&#8217;knigu, videt figu</em> (looking in a book, and seeing nothing.) Then I Google around, and a point of clarity starts to occur to me, because on Google they actually explain mathematical economics for people who have not taken a math class in 4 years or so.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Then, Mr. B hears me thrashing about and comes up to help, because he loves math, double-majored in math, and this is his leisure reading table at any given time:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2011/09/IMAG0888.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5716" title="IMAG0888" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2011/09/IMAG0888.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="368" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;What&#8217;s giving you problems,&#8221; Mr. B asks nonchalantly, and I give him a 20-minute sob story about how I am stupid and don&#8217;t understand anything and I&#8217;ve never had a class this hard and I&#8217;m dropping out, like, yesterday.  He reads the part in the econ book that corresponds to the math explanation.  10 minutes later,&#8221; Oh, that makes sense.  This is the answer, and here&#8217;s why.  And here&#8217;s why the math.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  He always tells me that no one has real talent, you just have to work at it.  No bigs.  Everyone can do math.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I think I&#8217;ll use my non-talent in English to write a novel about wives that throw things at their husbands.
