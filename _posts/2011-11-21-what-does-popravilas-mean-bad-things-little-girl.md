I know I&#8217;m doing something right when one of the search terms that leads people to my blog is &#8220;What does popravilas mean in Russian?&#8221;  Well, Googler, I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re American and your mother-in-law said this to you.  It means you&#8217;ve gained weight.  But it literally kind of means you&#8217;ve straightened out.  Sideways.

I know.  Russian women are the worst.

I would never say that anyone popravilas.  Except Oprah.
