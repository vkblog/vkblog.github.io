Wow.  Where do I start about our vacation to the England and Scotland last week?

I love to travel, and I live to travel.  Planning travel is a pain in the ass and makes me really stressed out, but the moment when I see the US disappearing below me is when I am at my happiest.  Being on an airplane, on a train, and in a car in a foreign country is the closest I&#8217;ve ever felt to being an optimist.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So far, Mr. B and I have been to Prague, <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/09/28/our-trip-to-israel-the-youtube/" target="_blank">Israel</a>, and a bunch of places in the US together.  Since we&#8217;ve been crazy with changing jobs and houses and everything, we haven&#8217;t been able to have a decent vacation aside from the few days we spent in <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/03/02/las-vegas-means-eating-drinking-and-discussing-the-nevada-real-estate-bubble/" target="_blank">Las Vegas</a> and <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/08/21/vickis-travel-guide-to-boston-for-the-temporarily-unemployed-and-anxious/" target="_blank">Boston</a> this year.  But a real vacation for me means leaving North America, and that&#8217;s exactly what we did when we went to England and Scotland last week.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Initially, I wanted to go to Argentina, because it&#8217;s warm in the winter.  But Argentina was $$$$$$.  So then I thought maybe Iceland, because it&#8217;s close by and really cheap in the winter. No dice, because Iceland has only 4 hours of daylight when we wanted to go.  Add a Russian to that equation, and you go suicidal.  The next logical location was the UK, because it&#8217;s relatively close from North America (6 hour flight from Philadelphia), and this time around, since we&#8217;d only leave for 6 days, I didn&#8217;t feel like dealing with logistics of travel in non-English (or Russian or Hebrew or Italian)-speaking countries.  For our next trip, I&#8217;m hoping we have 2 weeks for Japan (<a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/03/08/a-conversation-with-my-parents-about-india/" target="_blank">or maybe, India</a>).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  We spent 2 days in London, then took the train to Edinburgh, did a Scottish Lowlands tour, then took the train to Glasgow, did a Scottish Highlands tour, and then took an overnight sleeper train back to London.  After all of this, I have to say that, as much as I hate some things about Europe, including organizing travel in Europe,  I am completely besotted with both England and Scotland.  The Scottish Highlands and the history of Scotland as a nation especially left a very deep impression on me, and I&#8217;m hoping to write about it in a more coherent fashion after I organize my thoughts and figure out the best way to split them up into blog posts.

  In the meantime, here are some of my favorite snaps. Also, don&#8217;t make fun of my hat.  It was REALLY cold the whole time.  As always, clicky to enlarge.
