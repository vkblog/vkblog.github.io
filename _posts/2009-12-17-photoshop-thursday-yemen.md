There&#8217;s something about Yemen that catches the eye and the mind.  Yemen is one of the few countries left that&#8217;s not completely tamed, taken over by the McDonalds and Carrefours of the world.  [Sana&#8217;a](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sana%27a), pictured here, is ancient and one of UNESCO&#8217;s heritage sites.  At the same time, Yemen is more dangerous than ever, with a [border conflict with Saudi Arabia](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/12/reporting_from_yemen.html), almost [nonexistent human rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Yemen), and a [serious qat problem](http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/yemen.html).

And yet, the more dangerous and far away a place seems, the more I want to pack my bags.  [C.f. Kabul](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSCWVTjMwos).  Yalla!
