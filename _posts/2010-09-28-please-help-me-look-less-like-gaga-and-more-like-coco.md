I am starting my new job in three weeks and I have nothing (new-job-worthy) to wear. I am looking for something business casual but with a formal slant.  Skirts and pants alike are welcome.  I would describe my personal style as &#8220;blue&#8221; and &#8220;on sale&#8221; and &#8220;OH MY GOD IT ALMOST FITS ME I&#8217;M BUYING IT.&#8221;   Also, I am short and I hate buying pants.  And skirts that fall above the knee.  Because nothing fits well.

Basically what I&#8217;m saying is that I need a personal stylist.

This is all I have in my closet right now (I have both black and white, but I can&#8217;t really wear the white one any more since, you know, after Labor Day, also I think it&#8217;s growing stalactites):

Help.  Which office fashion blogs should I read that are not](http://corporette.com/) because every outfut on there costs more than I spend per week on food?  Maybe something [like this](http://www.academichic.com/2010/09/27/27-september-2010-black-and-white-week-day-1/)?
