During the first couple hours that Mr. B and I part ways on Sundays, I am extremely vulnerable to bawling. I don&#8217;t pick up the phone and I go do activities that minimize my contact with people I know so I don&#8217;t implode on them.  This weekend I happened to be in DC to run a mountain of errands including cleaning out as much of our apartment as we could, looking at new cars, getting Mr. B a haircut, shopping for a new cell phone for him, going to holiday parties, and other activities that almost make me feel like I&#8217;m married again.

It was a pretty refreshing weekend (if so extremely busy that we didn&#8217;t have time to see anyone) that gave me an enormous break from Philadelphia, because there are very few places in the world where you will see things like this this:

Just Tour de France in the middle of Tuckerman Lane. </em>
</p>

Even so, leaving the glittering lights of Georgetown and the Kennedy Center behind me on the George Washington Parkway at 4:30 PM when it&#8217;s already starting to get dark was the bleakest part of my week. So,  I turned on the radio, hoping some interesting news story on NPR (maybe about cats on welfare or organic weaponry in Afghanistan) would divert my attention.

Instead, I get [this](http://interfaithradio.org/node/1557).

  Oh, JESUS CHRIST.  Yes, I would please like to listen to how this woman lost her husband to Alzheimer&#8217;s and how he became weaker and weaker and how her Buddhism sustained her by teaching her compassion.  And yet, I couldn&#8217;t turn away from the station.  I was riveted, even through the part where she talked about the Doorway Moments, during the last part of his life when she knew that anytime she walked into a room, he could be DEAD.  So she would compose herself every time she touched the doorknob of a room where he was located before entering so she could be ready for the possibility of death.  &#8220;And it&#8217;s not as morbid as it sounds.  It was very calming.&#8221;  ohmygod.

  That&#8217;s when I turned off the radio and took my own life right there in the car by driving into the Potomac.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Just kidding.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I turned on my iPod and listened to the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCMQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiMTNT_BzkdA&ei=CR0GTfrkAsK78gbLvOTmAg&usg=AFQjCNEM-EDHqcFIIRos5hoQuN6a1Cs0Pg&sig2=pCTwl599QKT4594YH2MuhQ">Banana Boat Song</a> five times in a row.  And that cheered me right up.  Because, it might be about economic injustice and oppression (not to mention tarantulas!), but goddamnit it&#8217;s catchy. And I don&#8217;t even eat bananas.
