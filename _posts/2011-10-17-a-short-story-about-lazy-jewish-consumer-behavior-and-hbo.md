When we moved to our house in May, Mr. B and I were given the option to get a free trial of HBO and Cinemax with our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_FiOS" target="_blank">Verizon FIOS</a> subscription.

&#8220;We&#8217;ll cancel it when it&#8217;s up in August,&#8221; I said, because there is no way I was going to pay for whatever HBO and Cinemax cost.  I don&#8217;t even know what they cost per month.  All I know is that they&#8217;re not free, which means my Jewish brain says, &#8220;Cancel.&#8221;

The problem is that once you have HBO, you don&#8217;t want to go back to not having HBO. Not because HBO is so great, although I&#8217;d have to say that Big Love, The Sopranos, and Curb Your Enthusiasm are my favorite television shows because they are full of complexity and depth that mainstream shows don&#8217;t have. The problem is that there is absolutely nothing to watch on the 5934589 channels that we have, except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain:_No_Reservations" target="_blank">Anthony Bourdain</a> on Monday nights on Travel.  I can watch, like, 10 No Reservations episodes in a row because I feel that they teach me something.

I hate watching sitcoms at the time they&#8217;re supposed to be on because watching TV on schedule when there&#8217;s Hulu and DVR and Amazon and iTunes and \*cough\* other means of obtaining TV shows WITHOUT ads is for <a href="https://vkblog.github.io/?s=freier" target="_blank">freiers</a>.

But HBO always has something cool on.  Usually, though, it&#8217;s the same cool thing a couple days in a row.  But you&#8217;ll still watch it because it&#8217;s better than all of the other channels. Also, you&#8217;ll keep it on for background noise if your husband isn&#8217;t home because you are terrified of your house ever since <a href="https://vkblog.github.io/2011/07/21/how-loud-can-you-scream-thanks-to-either-nature-or-nurture-i-found-out-yesterday/" target="_blank">The Incident</a>.

So lately, for example, I&#8217;ve seen Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Junior maybe 7 times part of the way through.  Mr. B has watched parts of The A Team at least twice.  And together we&#8217;ve seen Men in Black in fragments at least 3 times from the part where Will Smith goes into the woman&#8217;s house and she tells her story and he flashy-things her and he&#8217;s like, &#8220;And you need to get an interior decorator in here quick, cause&#8230;damn.&#8221; Kills me every time.

As a result, life is passing me by.  There are new experiences I could be having, other things I could be doing, even new, interesting non-mainstream movies I could be watching, but instead I&#8217;m watching the same stuff all the time.  Every time Mr. B turns on Bad Boys 2 (&#8220;We ride together, we die together. &#8220;), I make a mental note to cancel not only HBO, but also our entire cable subscription and buy a <a href="http://www.roku.com/" target="_blank">Roku</a> box.

And then I watch Will Smith drive the van with the dead bodies full of cocaine for the fifth time and it&#8217;s totally worth it.
