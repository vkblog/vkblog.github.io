I haven&#8217;t had one of these in a while, and I&#8217;ve been inspired by playing around with [all kinds of typography](http://ilovetypography.com/). In other news, check out my f[irst actual Photoshop design for someone else](http://sfabrications.wordpress.com/), Sophie!  She is selling kick-ass purses.  <img src="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

If you are interested in something custom for free, let me know.  I am trying to learn Photoshop so it would work out great for me, and for you. But mostly for me.  Happy Thursday.
