<!-- Post Body Copy -->What it’s about: Two worlds, one is today&#8217;s, the other is the place where all pre-Christian Russian mythology has gone


  
Why it’s good: Very pressing plot, complicated characters, an intricately researched Russian culture
  
Why it’s bad: Too short!
  
Moral of the book:Still important to leave a lil&#8217; somethin&#8217; somethin&#8217; for the [domovoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domovoi)
  
Will I like it:  Yes, if you love fantasy and mythology, combined with Russian culture
