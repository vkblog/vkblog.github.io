Remember when I was [writing my novel](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/10/11/my-unborn-novel-is-annoying-me-nanowrimo/)?  And [everything was](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/11/25/i-am-thankful-for/) [going AWESOME](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/11/17/nanowrimo-day-15/)? And I was all up in the plot? [And you were helping tremendously](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/11/04/nanowrimo-day-4/)?

Well, now I&#8217;ve handed it over to Editor Vicki for the first round of revisions.   And it&#8217;s horrible.  It&#8217;s the most horrible novel known to man, even including [Vogon poetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogon#Poetry). It&#8217;s so horrible, Editor Vicki constantly makes disparaging comments, about the plot, the wording, the themes expressed in the novel, and the characters, including poor Michael, who hasn&#8217;t done anything except he&#8217;s just trying to move out of his parents&#8217; house.

Editor Vicki is evil, and she kills my will to live with her frequent, nasty comments,

If my editor doesn&#8217;t cut out making these depraved remarks, I am going to have to fire her.  Or maybe stab her.  Because I don&#8217;t see how else I can keep working on my manuscript without _constructive_ criticism.
