White people, known to be frequently prone to complaining about first-world problems, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/business/media/e-books-on-tablets-fight-digital-distractions.html?_r=2" target="_blank">are now having huge difficulties</a> reading on their <a href="https://vkblog.github.io/2011/08/02/the-great-news-im-getting-an-ipad-the-terrible-news-im-getting-an-ipad/" target="_blank">$200+ reading devices</a>, reports the <a href="https://vkblog.github.io/2011/12/01/new-york-times-story-idea-bingo-2011/" target="_blank">First World Problem Newspaper of Record</a>.

&#8220;It&#8217;s so hard,&#8221; a White Person that was interviewed recently reports. &#8220;Just as soon as I sit down to read in my air-conditioned house that&#8217;s not located anywhere near a warzone or a country that can&#8217;t hit the learn button and continuously re-elects a man that looks like death incarnate AND which has running potable water, I get distracted.&#8221;

&#8220;Oh yeah,&#8221; another White Person reported.  &#8220;If only there was a way to disable the internet on my $200+ reading device that can do virtually anything and get some real reading done.&#8221;

&#8220;Technology. It will be the fall of us all,&#8221; a third White Person shook his head sadly, and the three white people went to go get cappuccino.
