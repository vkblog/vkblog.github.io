Yesterday, [I posted](http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/08/jews-cant-marry-in-israel.html) on [DovBear](http://dovbear.blogspot.com/) about how Jews from the Former Soviet Union often cannot get married in Israel because they are not verified to be Jewish by the Rabbinate, which has a monopoly on Jewish marriage in Israel. The post got over 300 comments, which is not unusual for DovBear&#8217;s community of religious and non-religious Jewish readers alike, but it really is a hot button issue.

Here&#8217;s a little bit of background from my post:

> Anyone Jewish (again, how this is proven is up for debate) wishing to marry in the State of Israel must be married in a ceremony performed under the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. Christians, Muslims, and Druze have their own authorities. There is no option for a civil marriage in Israel, however, Israel recognizes civil marriages abroad.
> 
> Orthodox halachic rules are in order for anyone who wants to marry legally and Jewish-ly in Israel. Ethnic/ancestral Jews are not allowed to be married in Israel, due to halacha.
> 
> To convert, and be recognized, the person must have a conversion sanctified by the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel. The process is long and complicated, and a brief overview can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gov.il/FirstGov/TopNavEng/EngSituations/ESConversion/" target="_blank">http://www.gov.il/FirstGov/TopNa&#8230;s/ESConversion/ </a>

What it really made me wonder is **whether there are other countries, aside from Israel, that have a religious monopoly on marriage, and why they do so**.  Israel did so partly because [David Ben-Gurion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion), a thoroughly secular Jewish leader, made a compromise with the religious population that they could regulate this matter and leave him alone on other issues, figuring the secular Israelis would absorb the non-secular ones.  Well, that didn&#8217;t happen, and now here&#8217;s this issue.

Other countries regulating marriage I can think off the top of my head to get you started:

  * The United States, for not allowing gay marriage (a religious tenet)
  * The USSR didn&#8217;t allow any type of religious marriages
  * In Egypt, surprisingly, a marriage is legal only if it is performed in a in a civil local court (no religious provisions, interestingly enough)
