I&#8217;ve really been getting into podcasts lately.  I have the GRE coming up, and God knows I need to brush up on both my logical thinking and my vocabulary (the math is in a whole different circle of Hell for me.)  Podcasts fulfill several purposes for me: A) They get me through the morning commute; B) They help me internalize world news to use for the logic essay on the GRE and C) They catch me up on industry news (economics, international trade, etc) so I can sound semi-reasonable when talking to clients.

I was really happy to find this podcast, [EconTalk](http://www.econtalk.org/archives.html), which does nothing but discuss the issues of the day.  Granted, it&#8217;s not something you can put on in the background; you really have to listen. Especially if you don&#8217;t understand stuff, like me.  I just listened [to this one today](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2008/08/bueno_de_mesqui_1.html)

> <a href="http://www.hoover.org/bios/bdm.html" target="new">Bruce Bueno de Mesquita</a> of Stanford University&#8217;s Hoover Institution and New York University talks to EconTalk host [Russ Roberts](http://www.econlib.org/library/About.html#roberts) about threats to U.S. security, particularly Iran. Bueno de Mesquita argues that Iran is of little danger to the United States and that Ahmadinejad is an unimportant player in Iran&#8217;s political system, more of a stalking horse for provocative ideas rather than a wielder of power. Bueno de Mesquita then looks at what Iran has to gain and to lose by appearing to build a nuclear weapons program and actually using a nuclear weapon. He then goes on to examine the nature of other threats to the United States. The closing topic of the conversation is the peculiar incentives facing U.S. Presidents as their terms expire

It is really a different perspective from what I&#8217;ve been hearing on the news, and I&#8217;d like to discuss with someone who&#8217;s also listened to it.
