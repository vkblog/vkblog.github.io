For my upcoming birthday, I contemplated getting myself some perfume because I am out of whatever it is I bought a couple years ago. That makes me sound all mysterious and in-the-know, but what I really bought is this <a href="http://www.victoriassecret.com/beauty/mists/fragrance-mist-victorias-secret-pink?ProductID=4852&CatalogueType=OLS" target="_blank">Pink stuff from Victoria&#8217;s Secret</a> that&#8217;s not even technically a perfume but a spray.  It&#8217;s really embarrassing.  I don&#8217;t even want to show you because it screams fourth-grade gym class.  Ok, here it is.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7281" title="IMG_20120802_073646" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/08/IMG_20120802_073646.jpeg" alt="" width="291" height="388" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/08/IMG_20120802_073646.jpeg)

&nbsp;

But I like it.  Because it smells like fruit.  But I&#8217;m sadly not in fourth grade anymore.  So, I went to the perfume store in the <a href="http://www.shopsatliberty.com/" target="_blank">mall near work</a>.  I was immediately lost.  Because apparently women are not supposed to like really sweety, fruity scents. They&#8217;re supposed to like sophisticated things like Coco and Mademoiselle and whatever else, and they&#8217;re supposed to apply it to specific places to stimulate the smell and they&#8217;re supposed to be able to tell the difference between the different smells.   I gave up and walked out. For my birthday, I&#8217;m probably going to buy myself <a href="http://www.amazon.com/DwellStudio-Zig-Lapis-Runner-9-Feet/dp/B0070UDLXG/ref=sr_1_31?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1343602845&sr=1-31" target="_blank">something for the house</a>.

This is just the latest in a tradition of birthday woman-related gaffes.  For my fourteenth birthday, my dad bought me a gold necklace. I cried because what I really had wanted was an atlas (I think I was writing a short story about the state of Georgia at the time and we had really slow internet).  So we went back and returned it and I got my big, thick, life-size National Geographic atlas.

I lost my wedding ring three months after our ceremony.  I still use the atlas today.

For my last birthday, my parents bought me a beautifully thought-out jewelry necklace and ring set because &#8220;we want you to remember us when we&#8217;re gone&#8221;, you know, the usual Russian-guilt type thing.  I returned it for a jewelry set I liked more and I haven&#8217;t worn it ever again.

The only jewelry I can wear that I don&#8217;t lose is my engagement ring and a necklace that I originally bought at Target but that I loved so much that Mr. B had a copy made in silver for me.

What&#8217;s wrong with me?

I never wear makeup except special occasions because it takes too long to put on and it annoys me.  I have no idea what makeup is even right for me; I&#8217;ve been using the same routine of powder, eyeshadow, and mascara for over 10 years, which I think I discovered by accident by reading a Cosmo left in someone else&#8217;s house once.

This is my daily facial care routine.

This is literally what&#8217;s in my purse right now.  My writing notebook, my research book, paint swatches for the guest bedroom, extra pens, my wallet, and chapstick that I never use.

I have no idea how to style my hair correctly to make it look sleek.  I just know that it&#8217;s thick and frizzy and I need it out of the way as much as possible for work while still looking semi-human. I have no patience for a haircare routine that&#8217;s more than brushing and putting in a ponytail. A couple weeks ago, a friend introduced me to the <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=xlsImpprod4060123" target="_blank">Chi straightener</a>, which is the best thing ever for frizzy hair and makes you look d glamorous, but I&#8217;m too lazy to use it in the mornings, because honestly, it takes 5 minutes to warm up and then you have to use it for 10 minutes and I could just be writing a blog post instead.

Picking out clothes for my shape?  <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/09/please-help-me-look-less-like-gaga-and-more-like-coco/" target="_blank">Forget it</a>. I am just godawful and I have no patience for online shopping or real stores.

I am terrible at all of this stuff, and more. I&#8217;m not proud of it.  Somewhere along the way, I missed some basic lessons on how to be a woman correctly and every time I see someone apply makeup with expertise, I can only gape at them the way illiterate people must look at readers; they posses a kind of magic that they own for themselves.

I don&#8217;t want to stay this way.  I&#8217;ve read <a href="http://corporette.com/" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of <a href="http://frocksandfroufrou.com/" target="_blank">fashion</a> <a href="http://whatiwore2day.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">blogs</a>, watched <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=2&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=youtube+makeup+tutorials" target="_blank">hundreds</a> of makeup tutorials, and collected <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dress-Shaped-Dressing-Series-ebook/dp/B008JY6CQK" target="_blank">hundreds of tips</a> on &#8220;the right look.&#8221; But none of it still really seems applicable to me, so I&#8217;m going to declare fashion bankruptcy.

So , for my birthday, I&#8217;m going back to shopping for what I know best.

Creepy books about gualgs n&#8217;stuff.

AWWW YEAH.
