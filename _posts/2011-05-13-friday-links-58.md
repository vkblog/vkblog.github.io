This is what we come home to every day, in a variety of rooms:

So needless to say, I haven&#8217;t been up to writing lately. I wanted to write this really long post about how my dad came to help us paint last weekend, and one about _The Tudors_, which I started watching last night, and another one about  Israel&#8217;s Independence Day, and another about how we hung our mezuzah, but honestly, I am just exhausted every day and that last bit of energy goes to finding my Nutella.

So forgive the lack of posting lately.
