[Julia Ioffe](http://www.juliaioffe.com/articles/washington-post/a-russian-americans-uneasy-return-to-moscow/) has articulated what I&#8217;ve meant to write so well.

Where is the R in [BRICS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC)?  No Russians I know want to go back to Russia, myself included, no matter how much money the government provides. I&#8217;ve been extremely homesick for Russia, but then I remember that, in 2004 my dad was still afraid the Moscow hotel we were staying in was being wiretapped, and I snap out of it. For myself and Ioffe, the fact that our parents were Jewish refugees from a government that officially called them kikes may have something to do with it.

The economic boom there is for the kleptocracy, which I could never, ever get into.  The last time Russia welcomed repatriates, or &#8220;traitors,&#8221; was during the [Stalin &#8220;administration.&#8221;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daG--eMgbv0) Then they all got capped.  It&#8217;s no wonder that we&#8217;re all a little jumpy and, with the population decline, Russia is scraping the [bottom of every barrel of every immigrant population](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/22/world/europe/22believers.html) in the world.

I know people that have gone back to China and India for opportunities.  But if someone, like Ioffe, goes back to Russia, they are insane.  [Or end up writing a book about it](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1573229881).
