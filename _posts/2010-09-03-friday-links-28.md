Since it&#8217;s a 3-day weekend and I probably won&#8217;t be thinking about the world economy or [how ridiculous Putin is](http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2010/09/video_putins_common_touch_on_the_highway.htm), and Mr. B is actually going to the U.S. open to see Novak this weekend,  here&#8217;s a comic. Links if you can get to the bottom!
