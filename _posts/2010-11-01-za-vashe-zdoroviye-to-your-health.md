[This post](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2010/10/25/your-health-is-your-most-important-asset/) reminded me of something I&#8217;ve been thinking about for a while.

Russians are big on toasts during birthdays, etc. In the first toast to someone, the toaster (ha!) usually wishes for the recipient, the most important thing, their continued good health. We say it, we write it in emails, we text it, and we scribble it in birthday cards. Being healthy is the most important thing, before money, before love, and before Nutella, a sentiment I generally agree with when I&#8217;m not scarfing down

So riddle me this, Russian culture. Â Why is it that everything in you is inherent to avoiding good health?

I.e.:

  * Russian food
  * [Vodka](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/10/19/russia-tries-to-cut-down-on-alcohol/)
  * The lack of a physical exercise culture in Russia

And why the hell is this considered a &#8220;small&#8221; drink in America? If I had to estimate, this bad boy is probably 32 ounces.
