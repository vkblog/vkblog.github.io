Finally Friday and finally Hannukah!

I have yet to review  the DCJCC Film Festival (going on through Sunday!) films I saw yesterday-coming next week, along with a review of _Japan took the J.A.P._ out of me and a couple of other things.

Before I forget, I also wrote [Hebrussia this week for Alef magazine](http://www.alefnext.com/tonguetied/hebrussia/), about the combination of Hebrew and Russian.

1. [Iraqis in Jordan](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/8395828.stm), in pictures.
  
2.  T[he closure of McClatchy](http://blogs.mcclatchydc.com/jerusalem/2009/12/a-few-weeks-ago-i-ran-into-danny-seaman-the-head-of-israels-government-press-office-who-has-awell-cultivated-disdain-for.html) in Jerusalem
  
3.  [Female Saudi](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8368242.stm) television presenters
  
4. [In which countries](http://www.economist.com/daily/chartgallery/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15060097&fsrc=rss) do children have the worst teeth?
  
5.  [Are Israelis](http://howtobeisraeli.blogspot.com/2009/11/are-israelis-rude.html) rude?
  
6.  [Flowchart](http://flowingdata.com/2009/12/11/flowchart-helps-you-decide-what-cereal-to-eat/) helping you decide what to eat
  
7.  Good news!  The [Dubai crisis](http://www.gadling.com/2009/12/10/crisis-in-dubai-creating-fantastic-bargains-for-travelers/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+weblogsinc%2Fgadling+(Gadling)&utm_content=Google+Reader) is great for budget travellers!
  
8.  And the [recession is over](http://dcist.com/2009/12/recession_already_over_in_dc_area.php) in the DC area even before it started. But we knew that.
  
9.  The [origins](http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2009/12/the_origins_of_sovietology.htm) of Sovietology
