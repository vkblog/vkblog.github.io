I need to schedule a physical because I&#8217;m pretty sure I have _restless overreactive brain syndrome_ which will result in my untimely death and Mr. B becoming a young widower who finally gets some peace and quiet and doesn&#8217;t have to answer [my annoying questions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km3IXaLb070).  This is in spite of the fact that [I am now virtually bulletproof](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/03/15/whoever-said-life-is-about-adventure-and-risk-taking-never-had-typhoid-shots/).    But,  I&#8217;ve been having some trouble scheduling my physical.

The other problem is that healthcare knowledge is generally not public knowledge, at least to my knowledge,  so there is no rating system [I need to schedule a physical because I&#8217;m pretty sure I have _restless overreactive brain syndrome_ which will result in my untimely death and Mr. B becoming a young widower who finally gets some peace and quiet and doesn&#8217;t have to answer [my annoying questions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km3IXaLb070).  This is in spite of the fact that [I am now virtually bulletproof](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/03/15/whoever-said-life-is-about-adventure-and-risk-taking-never-had-typhoid-shots/).    But,  I&#8217;ve been having some trouble scheduling my physical.

(Although there have been [some](http://georgevanantwerp.com/2007/10/30/zagat-rating-system-for-doctors/) attempts.)

So I end up having to root around on my insurance company&#8217;s website for a list of doctors near my office and I get a list of physicians that includes their name, address, medical school, and specialty, which is not much to go by at all.

The process ends up going something like this,

So, for now, I am stuck.  If I could, I [would really stay away from](https://vkblog.github.io/2009/09/12/the-real-problem-with-healthcare-russian-cures/) Soviet-educated doctors. But other than that, I have no information upon which to base my decision.  This is extremely frustrating on several levels, one of which is that I can&#8217;t go to my old pediatrician anymore since he retired and therefore cannot receive a Tootsie Pop when I&#8217;m done with my visit.

Eventually, I&#8217;ll suck it up and pick one at random.

It&#8217;s not as big of a problem as this post makes it out to be.  But I really just wanted an excuse to post that last tweet one more time, because it&#8217;s the best thing I&#8217;ve written all summer.
