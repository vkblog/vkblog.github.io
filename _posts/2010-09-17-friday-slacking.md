I know I&#8217;m supposed to have crazy amounts of links for you today. But, it has been crazy over here this week.

Ok, ok, ok. Here&#8217;s a couple of links.  I laughed at this for [two straight hours](http://thebloggess.com/?p=8250).  And here&#8217;s [Hannah Szenes](http://www.harpyness.com/2010/09/11/poetry-saturdays-hannah-szenes/). And here&#8217;s some crazy [drunk marathon](http://www.aladyinlondon.com/2010/09/lady-runs-the-medoc-marathon.html).  But that&#8217;s all I got.

So, instead, here is a surreal picture of some mannekins near where we live.

Have an easy fast if you are fasting.
