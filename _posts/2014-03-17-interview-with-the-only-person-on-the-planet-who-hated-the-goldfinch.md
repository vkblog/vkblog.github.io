**Interviewer:**So. Vicki. You hated <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/books/the-goldfinch-a-dickensian-novel-by-donna-tartt.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0" target="_blank">The Goldfinch</a>.
  
**Vicki:** That&#8217;s correct.
  
**Interviewer:** Do you also murder small household pets?
  
**Vicki:** What?
  
**Interviewer:** You must hate humanity.
  
**Vicki:** No, I just&#8230;did not like this book at all.
  
**Interviewer:** Are you a secret Nazi?
  
**Vicki:** What? No! This interview became inflammatory very quickly.
  
**Interviewer:** I just find it hard to believe that someone doesn&#8217;t like one of the most-well-regarded books of 2014 so far. <a href="http://www.identitytheory.com/donna-tartt/" target="_blank">Donna Tartt</a> took ten years to write this thing (probably wearing <a href="http://www.themigrantbookclub.com/2013/10/donna-tartt-i-wear-it-to-remind-me-that.html" target="_blank">pantsuits the whole time</a>), she sweated, she labored over Theo, just so you could have this thing to read. Do you have a soul?
  
**Vicki:** I gave it a real try, honest. I read over 600 of the 700+ pages!
  
**Interviewer:** You didn&#8217;t try hard enough. Donna Tartt died so you could have this book.
  
**Vicki:** I&#8217;m pretty sure she&#8217;s still alive and doing VERY well off her book sales.
  
**Interviewer:** The book is on Amazon&#8217;s bestseller list. It was hailed as a &#8220;_The Goldfinch_ is a rarity that comes along perhaps half a dozen times per decade&#8221; by Stephen King. &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/book-review-the-goldfinch-by-donna-tartt/2013/10/22/39b556ac-3837-11e3-ae46-e4248e75c8ea_story.html" target="_blank">With a Dutch master’s attention to detail</a>&#8221; by the Washington Post.  And a &#8220;stunning success, one of the most striking novels I&#8217;ve read in years&#8221; by some dude on Amazon.
  
**Vicki:** I know, I know, I know. I tried to get into it! I liked some of the characters! I liked <a href="http://therumpus.net/2013/11/the-goldfinch-by-donna-tartt-2/" target="_blank">Boris, the creepy Eastern European dude</a>, and Popper, the dog. But I had to slog through every single page. But there is no feeling, nothing interesting, in ANY of the characters. I didn&#8217;t care that Theo&#8217;s mother died or that he was trying to get back to the East Coast, or about that stupid Goldfinch painting. I was just BORED. I was waiting for someone to die in a horrible fiery death again. Only if I didn&#8217;t have to read about Kitsey. KITSEY. STOP TALKING. SHUT UP KITSEY. I HATE YOU. I ALSO HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT FURNITURE, I DON&#8217;T CARE ABOUT FURNITURE AND I DON&#8217;T CARE ABOUT HOW DRUNK THEO GETS EVERY FIVE MINUTES.
  
**Interviewer:** You have no taste and you&#8217;re never allowed to blog again.
  
**Vicki:** But I LOVED her <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2013/12/my-favorite-books-of-2013/" target="_blank">Secret History</a>! I stayed up late at night reading it! I had high hopes!
  
**Interviewer:** You don&#8217;t know how to read English.
  
**Vicki:**  I&#8217;m not alone! I can&#8217;t be! PLEASE SOMEONE OUT THERE WHO HATED THIS BOOK.
  
**Interviewer:** The English-speaking Society for Classy Guys and Gals Who Read Pretentious Books on the Train hereby outsts you. Hand in your badge and your condescending smirk.
  
**Vicki:** I love that smirk. It&#8217;s how I know I&#8217;m better than  Danielle Steele.
  
**Interviewer:** You&#8217;re done.
  
**Vicki:** Am I allowed to read <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kKC1NxBcgS/" target="_blank">The Luminaries</a>? Or my <a href="http://instagram.com/p/kKC1NxBcgS/" target="_blank">Yiddish book</a>?
  
**Interviewer:** You can&#8217;t handle allegories, allusions, or explanations of art and society. You can&#8217;t empathize with characters, and you don&#8217;t understand the pains of real Authors. I hereby only allow you to read Dan Brown from now on.
  
**Vicki:** \*quietly sobs in the corner\*
