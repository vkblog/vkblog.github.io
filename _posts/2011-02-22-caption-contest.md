Guess what I finally found in the Swamp of Boykis Belongings that is Mr. B&#8217;s mom&#8217;s basement right now?  My beloved camera connector.  Which means more pictures!

Here&#8217;s the first one. In an idea I got [from Megan](http://bestoffates.com/), how about a caption contest?   Winner gets to proclaim he or she is the winner of my comment section. Which in the grand scheme of things means nothing, I realize.

This picture was taken in January, otherwise known as Helluary.
