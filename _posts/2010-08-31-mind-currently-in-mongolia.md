Mongolia borders other thoughts in my mind the same way it borers Russia in real life: quietly, peripherally, passively.

Mr. B always makes fun of me for being Mongoloid because sometime, vaguely, years ago, I mentioned to him that it&#8217;s possible that my dad&#8217;s side of the family, like many Russians, have Mongolian or Tatar ancestry after I saw a picture of my aunt when she was younger looking more Asian than European.  According to Armchair Anthropologist Boykis, this is the reason why I enjoy horses and always have a yearning to travel somewhere far away.

According to me, I love horses because I love all animals (except cats) and I have a yearning to travel away from armchair anthropologists.

So, in order to get closer to my (not-really) roots, I&#8217;ve started reading [Travels in an Untamed Land](http://www.amazon.com/Mongolia-Travels-Untamed-Jasper-Becker/dp/1845116496/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1283273011&sr=1-4) by [Jasper Becker](http://www.jasperbecker.com/), who got one of the first journalist visas after the collapse of the Soviet Union and writes with amazing detail about Mongolia.

I&#8217;ll try to do a full review once I&#8217;m done but this book is so cool I thought I&#8217;d share now.  It&#8217;s a travel book, history book, anthopological volume, and religious document all at once.  Becker describes his travels in chapters of themes, with one devoted to really creepy/cool shamanism, another to Buddhism, another to Mongolia under communism, etc. etc.  Of course there is one about Genghis Khan (which I am reading right now) but the point of the book is to stay away from broad stereotypes and delve into the minutiae of everyday life in post-communist Mongolia, much like a blog would.

Here is a list of stuff I&#8217;ve already learned about and I&#8217;m only halfway through:

  * [Marshal Choibalsan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khorloogiin_Choibalsan)
  * [Shamanism in Mongolia](http://sites.asiasociety.org/arts/mongolia/shaman.html)
  * [Kumis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis)
  * [Inner Mongolia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_Mongolia)
  * [Mongolian stamps](http://www.philatelicdatabase.com/philatelic-publications/stamps-of-mongolia-since-1945/)
  * [Shambala](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambhala)
  * Blue, blue, blue skies and open land

And here are  [some more really cool pictures from Mongoli](http://www.dreamers1.com/russia/Tashanta/Mongolia_Pictures.htm)a because I am getting inexplicable wanderlust again.
