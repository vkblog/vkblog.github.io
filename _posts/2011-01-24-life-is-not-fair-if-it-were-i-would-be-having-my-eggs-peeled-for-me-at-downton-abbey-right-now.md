The absolute best thing to do when one is cold, alone, and without the comforts of Nutella to aid one&#8217;s diet is to warm up a nice spot of tea and watching hot British people in the 1920s be assholes to each other.

Although there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m a secret [duchess or even a baroness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peerage), I can always dream about outsourcing some things in my life to make it easier, right?

A [Footman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footman) for starting the car before I go to work since it&#8217;s COLD, COLD, COLD, and most importantly, foot massages after a long run.  A [Porter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_(carrier)) for carrying my laptop to and from work. A [Butler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler) for telling me what kind of wine I can bring to parties without people knowing that it cost $10.99.  And, of course, a [scullery maid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scullery_maid) to do the endless stacks of dishes.  From Wikipedia: &#8220;The scullery maid also assisted in cleaning vegetables.&#8221; Excellent.  I can have her peel my oranges.

Doesn&#8217;t it suck that, nowadays, you have to be your own footman, butler, porter, scullerymaid, housemaid, housekeeper, and valet?  No wonder we never have enough hours in the day: we are doing the jobs of at least seven people at once.

Oh well.  I guess it&#8217;s a tradeoff for not having to wear corsets, riding sidesaddle, and marrying your cousin, each of which is more uncomfortable than the next.
