**30,249 words**! Whew.  I am over the half-way hump and on my way to the last 20,000 words (can you really call 20,000 words your last words?)  Michael is on his way from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea for Shabbat with two random Israeli girls who are driving to BeerSheva and also want to escape from the city in case they get Jerusalem syndrome.  Michael, obviously, has not had any luck on the marriage front yet.  Although, he has gotten an email which seems very promising.

I want to take this time to really thank everyone who&#8217;s been supporting my annoying journey. Thanks for answering my questions, and an especially big thanks to [[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1600" title="Page_1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2009/11/Page_1.jpg" alt="Page_1" width="500" height="100" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkblog/vkblog.github.io/master/public/img/2009/11/Page_1.jpg)

A quick note:  I [guest-posted](http://artandavarice.com/?p=135) yesterday at Milena Thomas&#8217;s Art and Avarice cultural economics blog about artists in society (if you haven&#8217;t been yet, you should go check it out.  Milena also writes a very interesting personal blog called [Quiet the Thunder](http://www.quietthethunder.com/2007/12/my-father-feminist.html). )

Questions:

1. Is it still seen as embarassing to have met friends or significant others online, or is the stigma gone?

2. How often are you out in the sun before you start getting sunburned, and how can you feel that you are sunburned?
