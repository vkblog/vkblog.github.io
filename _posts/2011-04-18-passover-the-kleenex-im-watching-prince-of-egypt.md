Everyone has their own Passover traditions.  Some people have those seder-thingies.  [Some people](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/03/PassoverLogo101.png) [eat matzah](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/03/15/you-know-its-spring-when-a-5-lb-box-of-matzah-from-amazon-arrives-on-your-doorstep/). Every year since college, I&#8217;ve watched Prince of Egypt and cried quietly in my room because I am really 10 years old and the only way for me to understand Passover is through a cartoon featuring the voices of Michelle Pfiefer and Ofra Haza.

Last year, I tried to include Comrade Atheist Mr. B in this tradition.  &#8220;Watch this with me.  Maybe you&#8217;ll understand what Passover is once and for all.&#8221;

&#8220;I understand Passover, but it&#8217;s not real.  None of it ever happened.  It&#8217;s a nice fairy tale.&#8221;

  &#8220;<a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Judaism/2004/12/Did-The-Exodus-Really-Happen.aspx">I know, I know,</a> but that&#8217;s not the point.  The point is that maybe not exactly that happened, but something did.  And we are still a people, and Passover celebrates our peoplehood.  Don&#8217;t you get any sense of pride over stuff that Jews accomplish? &#8220;

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4822" title="dust1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/04/dust1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="197" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/04/dust1.jpg)

&#8220;But what makes us a people?  It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re a softball team.  You can&#8217;t be proud of being Jewish just because you were born Jewish. Sure, I feel proud of Jewish intellectual accomplishments, of the tradition of education, but not because they were born Jewish. &#8221;

&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain feeling Jewish to you.  You either do or you don&#8217;t.  A cartoon&#8217;s not going to change that for you, but I thought you might want to celebrate something that&#8217;s meaningful to me, even if neither of us believe in the religious aspect. &#8221;

&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;ll watch so you leave me alone.&#8221;

&#8220;You should get into it. Like, remember when we were in Prague and you felt that the whole country was anti-Semitic, partly because the [Czech word for Jew](http://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDid%C3%A9) means kike in Russian? And even after we went into all the synagogues and we complained about how it was a rip-off designed to pull money away from Rich American Jew tourists, you still wore your kippah?  Why didn&#8217;t you take it off? You hate kippot.&#8221;

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4829" title="kippah" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/04/kippah.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="512" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/04/kippah.jpg)

&#8220;Because I feel more Jewish when there is anti-Semitism.&#8221;

&#8220;Ah, so you do feel Jewish after all.&#8221;

&#8220;I guess.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;

A very sameach hag to you if you&#8217;re celebrating Passover.  And if you&#8217;re not, I&#8217;ll still see you in my room because I need you to hook up the DVD player.
