I was listening to Mary Poppins post-workout yesterday. The point is not that I&#8217;m 22 and listen to Julie Andrews to cool down.  The point is that kids are given crappy movie-watching choices these days.  Or maybe there are movies as good as Mary Poppins with songs of the same quality (i.e. Wall-e,) but there is an uneven distribution of the majority of songs being crap in the childrens&#8217; song market.  Disney Channel, I&#8217;m looking at you.  Why are you unraveling all of your years of good work with Hannah Montana and Cody and Zach and whatevs.   Parents, what say you? I don&#8217;t know anything.  I&#8217;m just groovin&#8217; to Mary P. This song gives me goosebumps.
