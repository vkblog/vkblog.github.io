  1. [I agree with this 110%.](http://utahtechjobs.com/2010/yes-your-resumes-file-name-does-matter.htm) I have been editing resumes for about 3 years now, did 3 this week, and this advice is correct.
  2. [One of the only times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/fashion/03dating.html?_r=1&ref=books) I wish I were single.
  3. [The image on this post is NSFW](http://www.tabletmag.com/news-and-politics/60406/foreplay/), but the post is SFW, although kind of gross. But also very Jewish.
  4. [I can&#8217;t help but wonde](http://www.fastcompany.com/1733627/mit-scientist-captures-his-sons-first-90000-hours-on-video)r, did they fight on camera, too? But this is very, very cool.
  5. [It is not too late for me](http://www.hostessblog.com/2011/03/aliyeh%E2%80%99s-alice-in-wonderland-birthday-party/).
  6. [Whoops!](http://www.economicpopulist.org/content/imf-rates-dictatorships-just-revolutions)

  8. [100 people less lazy than me](http://www.womendeliver.org/updates/entry/women-deliver-100-the-most-inspiring-people-delivering-for-girls-and-women/)
  9. [Glamor](http://scaryazeri.blogspot.com/2011/03/glamorization.html)
 10. [The opposite of glamor](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/02/child_brides)
 11. [Secrets are fun](http://thecynicalgirl.com/off-the-grid-fridays-secrets/)
 12. [Good idea](http://andfaraway.net/blog/2011/03/03/disneys-dream-portrait-series-by-annie-leibovitz/), bad casting.
 13. [Yes.](http://www.themillions.com/2011/03/are-you-or-have-you-ever-been-a-jewish-writer.html) But no.
 14. I [feel bad ending a week with this link](http://thehairpin.com/2011/03/dead-frogs-with-pina-coladas/), but it&#8217;s a must, I think.
