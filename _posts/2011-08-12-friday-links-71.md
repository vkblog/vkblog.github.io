Today is the first day of my mini-vacation before I start my new job and grad school in a couple of weeks.  What am I doing? Getting my nails done, shopping for jewelry, trying on furs, and running my Russian restaurant.  At least this is what I would be doing if I were a REAL RUSSIAN WOMAN.  Instead, I&#8217;m cleaning the house in preparation for my aunt coming from Russia this weekend, visiting my grandpa, and making soup.  EPIC LETDOWN.

And you?

And, Just because, this GIF is called &#8220;Rioting fail&#8221;
