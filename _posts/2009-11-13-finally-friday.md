Today marks the confluence of a couple of things:

1. I&#8217;ve reached the 25,000 word mark [on my novel](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/?s=nanowrimo)!  That&#8217;s half-way.  Now the rest should be downhill, right? At this point, I&#8217;m going on 6 hours of sleep. If you&#8217;re interested in seeing my writing graphed mathematically, my awesome friend @carolejesse had done [just that](http://twitpic.com/p8ex9).

2.  It&#8217;s Mr. B&#8217;s birthday!  He&#8217;s turning a quarter of a century.  That means he should now be wise, right?

3.  I&#8217;m guest-posting on my friend Hadassah&#8217;s blog, about &#8220;[My Judaism](http://hadassahsabo.wordpress.com/2009/11/13/my-judaism-4/).&#8221;  It&#8217;s a long and sordid tale, so you can head over to check it out if you&#8217;re interested.

Here are some Friday links for you (because I definitely skipped last week):

  1. [Why giving money to beggars doesn&#8217;t help the poor in India](http://gorigirl.com/begging-in-india-and-how-to-actually-help-the-poor) (or elsehwere) by my online and offline friend GoriGirl
