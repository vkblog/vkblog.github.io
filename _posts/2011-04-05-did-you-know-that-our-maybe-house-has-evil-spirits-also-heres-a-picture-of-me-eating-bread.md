So, in preparation for possibly-maybe-our new house at the end of the month (if nothing goes wrong, tfu, tfu, tfu, knock on wood, eat a chicken bone and whatever the hell it is you do to stop from believing in the pit of your stomach that you will never, ever be a homeowner), I&#8217;ve been researching why men need to carry women over the threshold of their new house.

Evil spirits.

Evil spirits.

Does](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/03/23/the-world-is-going-crazy-so-hopefully-reading-about-my-radon-problems-will-cheer-you-up/) count as evil spirits?

Because it should.

Our house has evil spirits. More than 4 picocuries per liter&#8217;s worth. How&#8217;s that for scientific evidence?

P.S.B.T.W, did you know that the threshold is a bad place in general?  I found this [really awesome book](http://books.google.com/books?id=Ue4MAAAAIAAJ&ots=BSxvJ6wIqk&dq=carrying%20the%20bride&lr&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=carrying%20the%20bride&f=false) that talks about it, although it&#8217;s cut off. Boo  <img src="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />But you can get it as a FREE PDF!!! And you can find out all about the superstition of thresholds and how it comes from the Old Testament.

Oh yeah.

Radon!

Which sounds suspiciously like Dagon, actually.
