</p>

Still my favorite philosopher/economist/misanthrope. Still agree with him on nearly everything.

> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9711211/Antifragile-by-Nassim-Taleb-review.html" target="_blank"><strong><i>Antifragile</i></strong></a>** **resembles a self-help book, though it is difficult to imagine any other self-help book as intemperate and cranky. The author is a tireless self-aggrandiser, boasting of his gargantuan reading habits; of being a weightlifter, ready to physically slap down detractors; and a gourmand, recommending fine wines and camomile tea to ease a troubled mind.

Here are some excerpts from press about <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/This-Is-Not-a-Profile-of/136257/" target="_blank">him+ Antifragile</a>:

> Actually, _Antifragile_ feels like a compendium of people and things Taleb doesn&#8217;t like. He is, for instance, annoyed by editors who &#8220;overedit,&#8221; when what they should really do is hunt for typos; unctuous, fawning travel assistants; &#8220;bourgeois bohemian bonus earners&#8221;; meetings of any kind; appointments of any kind; doctors; Paul Krugman; Thomas Friedman; nerds; bureaucrats; air conditioning; television; soccer moms; smooth surfaces; Harvard Business School; business schools in general; bankers at the Federal Reserve; bankers in general; economists; sissies; fakes; &#8220;bureaucrato-journalistic&#8221; talk; Robert Rubin; Google News; marketing; neckties; &#8220;the inexorable disloyalty of Mother Nature&#8221;; regular shoes.

> A reader could easily run out of adjectives to describe Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s new book “Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder.” The first ones that come to mind are: maddening, bold, repetitious, judgmental, intemperate, erudite, reductive, shrewd, self-indulgent, self-congratulatory, provocative, pompous, penetrating, perspicacious and pretentious.

  He also comes across as a helluva personality: irascible, finicky, vain, prone to fits of pique at those who mischaracterize his ideas (uh-oh, better watch out), disdainful of journalists (double uh-oh), a weightlifter, too (this is your third and final warning).

  On the other hand, he has habits I admire: He told the New Scientist he only goes to doctors if he’s really sick, he takes a dose of local water (a drop, no more) when visiting India (good for the immune system) and apparently he’s never been in debt

    <b>You&#8217;re critical of various groups who claim to be able to predict and manage the future &#8211; which, in your opinion, has done the most damage? </b>The most damaging group are economists; probably the most damaging individual is [former chairman of the US Federal Reserve] Alan Greenspan, and maybe also [current Fed chairman] Ben Bernanke and [US treasury secretary] Timothy Geithner. The reason I&#8217;m against the top-down state isn&#8217;t so much theoretical, but because of what I call having skin in the game &#8211; bureaucrats have no personal stake in their decisions. I don&#8217;t tell you what I predict; I tell you what&#8217;s in my portfolio. So economics-wise, I don&#8217;t want people to tell me what to do; I want to know what they&#8217;re doing.

    &#8220;Exactly!&#8221; says Taleb. Once you get over the idea that you&#8217;re reading some sort of popular economics book and realise that it&#8217;s basically Nassim Taleb&#8217;s Rules for Life, it&#8217;s actually rather enjoyable. Highly eccentric, it&#8217;s true, but very readable and something like a chivalric code d&#8217;honneur for the 21st century. Modern life is akin to a chronic stress injury, he says. And the way to combat it is to embrace randomness in all its forms: live true to your principles, don&#8217;t sell your soul and watch out for the carbohydrates
