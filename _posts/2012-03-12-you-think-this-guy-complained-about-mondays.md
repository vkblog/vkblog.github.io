&#8220;During the Winter War (1939–1940), between Finland and the Soviet Union, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simo_H%C3%A4yh%C3%A4" target="_blank">he began </a>his duty as a sniper and fought for the Finnish Army against the Red Army. In temperatures between −40 and −20 degrees Celsius, dressed completely in white camouflage, Häyhä was credited with 505 confirmed kills of Soviet soldiers.A daily account of the kills at Kollaa was conducted for the Finnish snipers. Besides his sniper kills, Häyhä was also credited with over 200 kills with a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun.Remarkably, all of Häyhä&#8217;s kills were accomplished in fewer than 100 days at a time of year with very short hours of daylight.&#8221;
