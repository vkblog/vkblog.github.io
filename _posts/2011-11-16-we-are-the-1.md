So, I was looking back at old honeymoon videos from Miami (oh, what a godsend that I discovered digital photography right around then), and realized why I cannot relate to Occupy Wall Street at all. Zaaaaaaa.



P.S. We rented it from a Â v. sketchy dealership since we were both under 25 at the time and no national chain rents to under-25s, even under-25s who have no history of accidents. Ah, to be young and unable to rent a Sebring.
