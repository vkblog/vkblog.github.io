Things I want to blog about but can&#8217;t because we still don&#8217;t have high-speed internet at our new apartment yet (hopefully by the end of tomorrow):

  * The [Air Force Memorial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Memorial) and how cool it is, especially since you can almost see it from our apartment:[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2822" title="DSC_0179" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/04/DSC_0179.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/04/DSC_0179.jpg)
  * [Ari Gold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Gold_%28Entourage%29) and how I want to be him
  * Our potential trip to California
  * Weird girls like [Regina Spektor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina_Spektor)
  * How depressing [Stars on Ice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_on_Ice) is
  * My mom&#8217;s lilac:

but for now, I remain wireless and WiFi-less yours,
