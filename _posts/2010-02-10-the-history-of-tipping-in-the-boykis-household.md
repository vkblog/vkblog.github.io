I just saw [this cute infographic](http://www.billshrink.com/blog/the-history-of-tipping/) ([via ChartPorn](http://chartporn.org/2010/02/09/tipping-is-not-a-city-in-china/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ChartPorn+%28Chart+Porn%29)) of how much people tip and some of the psychological reasons behind tipping, and I decided to make my own, based on the Boykis household. And what did I learn?Â  Infographics are hard as hell to make.
