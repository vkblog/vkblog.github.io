From third grade up until I graduated, I played the clarinet (which I named, appropriately, Zephyr).  We got to choose instruments in third grade, and, despite my dad&#8217;s best interest in almost forcing me to play the saxophone, I chose the clarinet.  I was never great at playing the clarinet, but I did manage get  enjoyment out of playing pieces correctly for audiences and in constantly trying to get better.

This weekend, I decided to pick up my clarinet again and play some easy pieces, much to the dismay of my parents and my husband.  The strangest thing happened: even though I haven&#8217;t played it since graduating, my fingers remembered everything.  The same thing happens when I play the piano; often, I forget some of the exact notes that I played,but my fingers remember the position.  Intrigued, I decided to explore this concept a bit further.

I found out that this concept is called [muscle memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory).

(as well as](http://www.dbpeds.org/media/childbrain.pdf) that tells me exactly how I will drive my child to overachievement.) It&#8217;s always fascinating to find out how your brain works in real life.  My play time was so enjoyable that I might pick up the clarinet again once we have our own house and are not surrounded on four sides by neighbors.  In the meantime, I can only dream of this (my tryout piece for 1st clarinet in 11th grade.  Obviously I didn&#8217;t make it.)
  


And here&#8217;s my horrible Photoshop for today:
