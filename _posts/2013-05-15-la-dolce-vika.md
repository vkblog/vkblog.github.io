My parents have been doing some spring cleaning lately. And by spring cleaning, I mean my mom called me and said, &#8220;We have five boxes of your crap in the attic. Can we throw it out?&#8221;  My crap being everything I&#8217;ve ever generated artistically or scholastically since first grade.

<!--more-->

&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you keep it,&#8221; I asked, distraught. &#8220;Because we are trying to clean out the attic,&#8221; my mom said. &#8220;The Germans did too,&#8221; I muttered, &#8220;And look what happened to Anne Frank.&#8221; &#8220;What?&#8221; &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;

&#8220;You should take this stuff,&#8221; my mom said. &#8220;You can keep it in your home.&#8221;

I tell everyone we are minimalists because it makes me feel smug, so I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a minimalist. I can&#8217;t possibly have all this crap along with all the other crap I have lying around.  Even though it&#8217;s not crap but my priceless childhood thoughts and dreams. Don&#8217;t you care about your only daughter&#8217;s priceless childhood thoughts and dreams,&#8221; I tried to guilt her.

But, as everyone knows, you can&#8217;t guilt a Jewish mom, and the end is result, as you can see from the picture on this post, is that I now have three boxes of crap in my attic that I am going through slowly.  I&#8217;ve found at least four of my diaries, all of which show that I was just as neurotic and melodramatic as I am now, only there weren&#8217;t blogs to show me that there were people even weirder than me.  Also, Jesus Christ am I glad blogs didn&#8217;t exist back then.

Fortunately, in my junior year of high school, I got hit by the Italian bug and started learning Italian. I was super-into making scrapbooks of things, and I found that scrapbook. This Italian which will be very helpful when we go on vacation.

As you can tell, math wasn&#8217;t a strong suit. Although LOVE and FATE and The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy? Sure. Oh god, that pun.

I also did a bit of song translation:

How disappointing that YouTube didn&#8217;t exist back then. I just watched <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/02/why-do-you-have-to-discover-adriano-celentano-cruel-internet/" target="_blank">this song</a> that I translated for the first time ten minutes ago and it all came back to me.



I have reams and reams of paper to prove what a huge nerd and social outcast I was. What will future generations have? Their Tumblrs? Please.

Thanks for the memories, mom.
