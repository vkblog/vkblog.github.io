I&#8217;m up to **7,657** words, and, with your feedback am navigating through a wedding reception where Michael is sitting at a tableful of pregnant women. It&#8217;s a little slow going right now, so I&#8217;m really trying to hurry him through so he can finally get on that plane to Israel!

**Questions for today:**

1. If you&#8217;ve been set up with someone you&#8217;ve never seen before, what were your expectations for the meeting?

2. Do you know anyone who is scared of dogs?Â  Why are they scared of them, and how do they express it?
