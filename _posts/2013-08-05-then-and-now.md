**Things I thought I would be doing at 27 when I was 7:**

  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">Being the CEO of a major company </span>
  * Having 7 dogs (3 Corgis, 2 collies, 1 Border Collie, and 1 Golden Retriever)
  * Eating as much candy as I want
  * Living in a castle by the sea
  * Owning ponies
  * Having a really serious business suit
  * Being a world-famous author
  * having a licenseplate that said VICKIK13
  * Living in Colorado, California, or Florida
  * Being a graphic designer
  * Eating ice cream every day
  * Staying up as late as I want

**Things I&#8217;m actually doing now: **

  * Being the CEO of my household
  * Still being afraid of buying business suits
  * <span style="line-height: 13px;">Planning on watching The Lion King and drinking champagne tonight</span>
  * Buying frozen yogurt instead of ice cream because it has less calories
  * Taking walks after dinner
  * Avoiding driving and figuring out how to pay less in car insurance for a vehicle I never use
  * Calculating my 401k
  * Searching for high-thread count sheets on sale on Amazon
  * Staying away from WebMD
  * Staying up as late as I want on the Internet, as long as I go to bed by 10 so I can wake up early to write

Yikes.
