**Total word count to date:**17121 and it&#8217;s starting to get harder and harder to write.

Michael has arrived in Israel, been terrorized by a dog more than actual terrorism, has met his host family&#8217;s kids, and had his first day out in Tel Aviv.  Now, as the sun sets, he prepares for a dinner party that his family is having so he can &#8220;meet&#8221; this girl that Genya wanted to set him up with.  In light of this,

1.  What is the worst thing that could go wrong at a party where two people are artificially arranged to meet each other?

2.  What kind of food to serve at such a gathering, and are the girl&#8217;s parents eager to have a potential suitor from America?

This weekend, I stumbled across two articles, neither of which are particularly encouraging to my writing process.  The first is advice to aspiring writers from [John Irving in which](http://bigthink.com/johnirving/advice-to-aspiring-novelists-dont-shoot-yourself) he says that he would shoot himself if he were 27 and currently writing a novel, and the second is from [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703740004574513870490836470.html), of writing habits of famous authors.  All of them are pretty painful and I can completely relate.  Maybe someday someone will write about me, &#8220;She used to sit at her computer, screaming at herself that pretty much everything she wrote was horrendous, then wrote a hundred more words, thought horrendous again.  But now she is a bajillionaire novelist who has frequent lunches with Orhan Pamuk and Junot Diaz, teaching them how to write,  and laughs all the way to the bank in her black BMW.&#8221;
