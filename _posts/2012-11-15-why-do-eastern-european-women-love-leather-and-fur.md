While Mr. B and I were in <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2012/10/marie-laveau-and-kirks-magic-voodoo-fingers-help-us-fight-sandy/" target="_blank">New Orleans</a>, it was cold. Super-cold. Cold enough that we hadn&#8217;t planned for it. Isn&#8217;t the South always supposed to be perma-warm like that spot on the floor that always gets the sun?

Long story short, we had to buy clothes on vacation.

First things first. Oh, the irony:

  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/11/IMG_20121109_082918.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7849" title="IMG_20121109_082918" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/11/IMG_20121109_082918-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="502" /></a>
</p>

Then, for five seconds, this was an option:

  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/11/IMG_20121027_131947.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7848" title="IMG_20121027_131947" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/11/IMG_20121027_131947-768x1024.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="502" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Until I realized I had become every woman I see at the Russian store. And I became terrified.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Why do Russian women love fur? What is it that brings out the fur coats, the fur collars, the leather?  And why do American women hate them?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;m guessing it has something to do <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Vn86VZEdwc4C&lpg=PA1&ots=zBG0EM-wpd&dq=russian%20women%20fur%20leather%20love%20why&lr&pg=PA2#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">with this:</a>

  Although I&#8217;m too lazy to research. So I&#8217;m crowd-sourcing.

   Also, I did find this:
