If you were National Public Radio&#8217;s [MIchele Norris](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100974) (emphasis mine) and [Steve Inskeep](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6000#N), what would you think about crazy psycho girl in the audience taking pictures of you on a rainy [Thursday night in the Philadelphia Free Library](http://www.phillyfunguide.com/event/detail/440796789/A_Conversation_with_Michele_Norris_The_Grace_of_Silence_A_Memoir) as you had [a conversation about race](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129995444) and your new book? Would you be scared to know that aforementioned psycho girl had taken a tour of NPR headquarters in DC the previous week?

If you were a library patron in the Philadelphia Free Library, Vine Street Branch on a rainy Thursday night in October, what would you think about crazy psycho girl in the asiles taking picture of your pretty library and your funny transliterated Russian books ?

If you were a mother-in-law, what would you think after calling crazy psycho daughter-in-law to find out why she wasn&#8217;t home at 7:30 on a Thursday night and, instead of imagining her stuck on the side of I-95 North with a flat tire, you were relieved (?) to find out that she was attending a conversation about race with people from NPR?
