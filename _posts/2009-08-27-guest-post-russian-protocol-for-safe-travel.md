_Note: If you are reading this post, then we are in Israel and I am definitely not posting anytime soon because I am too busy eating falafel/singlehandedly fighting Hamas.    Today&#8217;s guest post is from [Marinka](http://www.motherhoodinnyc.com/), who is also a Russian Jew, and therefore also inherently awesome.  Except, she also has kids AND a cat named Nicki, all of which she deals with deftly and with a sharp wit, so she might just be more awesome than me.  Maybe._ 

The first time my American- born husband left our marital abode for a business trip, I was certain that he was going to detour into town to get an emergency annulment.  Because he thought that he could just walk out the door, with a goodbye kiss to me and an &#8220;I&#8217;ll email when I land,&#8221; completely and totally disregarding the Russian Protocol for Safe Travel.  I mean, I can&#8217;t guarantee the safety of the flight if he refuses to follow it.

&#8220;You didn&#8217;t sit on your suitcase,&#8221; I tried.
  
&#8220;What&#8217;s that now?&#8221; he paused at the door.
  
&#8220;Your suitcase, you just picked it up. You have to sit on it,&#8221; I knew that I sounded mildly insane, but I&#8217;m sure the Wright Brothers got a few odd looks in their time, too.
  
&#8220;On my suitcase?&#8221; He asked.  Did I just not clearly say that he has to sit on his suitcase?  Was my new groom not particularly bright?
  
&#8220;It&#8217;s good luck,&#8221; I explained.  I was hoping that this would suffice and that I wouldn&#8217;t have to get pen and paper for the visuals.
  
&#8220;OK,&#8221; he said, slowly.  Like he was a hostage negotiator or something. &#8220;I will sit on the suitcase.&#8221;
  
He sat on his suitcase and we looked at each other.
  
&#8220;Now you&#8217;re supposed to say &#8220;ne pucha, ni pera,&#8221; I alerted him.
  
&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;
  
&#8220;NE PUHA, NI PERA,&#8221; I used the time-tested technique of saying the foreign words louder to make the other person understand.
  
&#8220;Pe tuca, caravan,&#8221; he said. Or something that made a complete mockery of the Russian Protocol for Safe Travel.
  
&#8220;NE PUHA NI PERA, NE PUHA NI PERA, GOD!  I&#8217;m not asking you to split the atom here!&#8221;
  
&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; suddenly my husband became an anthropologist.
  
&#8220;It means &#8221; &#8216;Neither fuzz, nor feathers&#8217;.  Why do you ask?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t understand what the Russian means, although your translation doesn&#8217;t exactly clear it up for me.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Oh, that,&#8221; I chuckled at his innocence.  &#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re supposed to say that to hunters when they go to hunt.  Sort of a may you not hunt any animal or bird that has fuzz or feathers.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that means that you are wishing them an unsuccessful hunt?&#8221; He asked.  It was starting to seem to me that our entire courtship was just a pretense until he got that ring on my finger and now he could start the interrogation about all things Russian.
  
&#8220;Not really,&#8221; I explained.  &#8220;Because you&#8217;re sort of saying this sarcastically.  Like, you&#8217;re really wishing them the opposite.  Like lots of animals with fuzz and feathers.&#8221;
  
He didn&#8217;t seem reassured.
  
&#8220;And what does the hunt for these mythological creatures have to do with my taking a flight this afternoon?&#8221;
  
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a short way of saying &#8220;have a good flight!&#8221; &#8221;
  
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem like a short way.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Well, not with all the explanations, no.  Usually we just say it and go on our way.  The tutorial is extra.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Got it.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Ne puha, ni pera.&#8221; I reminded him.
  
&#8220;Ne puhu, nu pura,&#8221; he said.  Close enough.
  
&#8220;K chertu,&#8221; I said.
  
&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t a sneeze, right?&#8221;
  
&#8220;No.&#8221;
  
&#8220;What did you say?&#8221;
  
&#8221; &#8216;Go to hell&#8217;,&#8221; I motioned him to get up.
  
&#8220;That&#8217;s nice.&#8221;
  
&#8220;That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to say.  You&#8217;re supposed to send to hell that wish that your hunt is unsuccessful.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Got it.  Are we done now?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Almost.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Almost?&#8221;
  
&#8220;I just remembered that the person staying behind should say &#8220;ne puha, ni pera&#8221; and the person leaving should say &#8220;k chertu&#8221;,&#8221; I confessed.  &#8220;So sit back down on the suitcase, and I&#8217;ll say &#8220;ne puha, ni pera&#8221; and you&#8217;ll say &#8216;k chertu&#8217;.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Make it &#8220;go to hell;&#8221; he said, &#8220;And you&#8217;ve got yourself a deal.&#8221;
