I&#8217;ve been reading a lot lately about how economists are predicting an uptick in the world economy, just because of a couple key indicators.   First, there were the [durable goods upticks](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ajkPSFloHWDs&refer=news) in the United States.

> Orders placed with U.S. factories rose in February for the first time in seven months, reflecting a rebound in demand for construction machinery, computers and air conditioning equipment that signals the worst of the manufacturing slump has passed.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It definitely has not.  Just because one indicator is pointing upward, doesn&#8217;t mean that the rest of them will follow, particularly given the hefty deficit spending Obama is about to institute.   Additionally, there was the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/financial-sym-tt0401.html">news from MIT</a>:

>   Nearly six months after a panel of five MIT faculty experts in economics and business warned that the financial crisis would get much worse, the same group re-convened and identified a few bright spots on the economic horizon.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Despite these two spots, the recent analysis I&#8217;ve been doing on world trade for our first quarter forecast shows that we still have a long way to go.  It&#8217;s just frustrating that the media will pick up on any signs of positivity and run with it to reflect a complete turnaround.  Although, with consumer confidence as a kind of chicken-and-the-egg story, maybe that&#8217;s exactly what we need to jumpstart the economy.
