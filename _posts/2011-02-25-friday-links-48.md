What&#8217;s better than reading my complaining on my blog?  [How about reading it in an ebook](http://njop.org/resources/shabbat/jewish-treats-complete-guide-to-shabbat/)? Put together by my Twitter friend [Suzanne](http://twitter.com/#!/susqhb)?  About Shabbat? Clickly clickly on the link to register and download the PDF, if you so desire.

I should probably mention that this piece was edited to exclude the fact that what I&#8217;ve eaten by accident on Yom Kippur was shrimp and the way I currently commemorate Shabbat is by listening to Shabbat music on my iPod while I am driving between Philly and DC on Friday nights.  Fortunately, these pieces of information were taken out in the final version to save me from myself.

**Friday Links:**

  1. If socialism is bad, [why do the socialists have everything that is good and pure](http://www.alv.se/en/park) about life?
  2. &#8220;[This being the modern, technology-driven world](http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/why-i-love-the-kindle/), what we get in place of the above, if we choose to buy a Kindle, is convenience: no more bookstores; no more waiting for Amazon packages to arrive; no more dog ears; no more weight in our bags; no more bookmarks.&#8221;
  3. Yes. [I&#8217;m in the 94%](http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com/post/3485891008).
