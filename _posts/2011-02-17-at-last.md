No Friday Links today, but something even better.

Mr. B is moving and starting a new job in Philly over the next couple of weeks.

Let&#8217;s cue the song that [we first danced to at our wedding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT-_HZ_xMnc&feature=related).



I am so, so, so proud of  him for finding a job, in a recession (which is quickly turning into stagflation,) in a city that is not exactly JOB CENTRAL.

Actually, I&#8217;m going  pat myself on the back too, because Philly is a terrible job market for econ nerds (and foreign policy nerds, and &#8230;&#8230;).Even though we are young, college-educated, and pretty much native English speakers, all of which theoretically gives us a leg up, this was no less of an accomplishment and I&#8217;m sure you all want to congratulate us and buy us bottles of champagne.

It&#8217;s ok. I anticipated your sentiments and bought one or five for myself.

Because after almost five months of living apart, driving three hours back and forth, agonizing waiting,  hideous anxiety attacks which have only recently started to abate (me), eating cereal for dinner (him), and having to peel my own oranges, we can really use some vino.

Next steps include adjusting to living together again as Oscar and Felix (can you guess which of us is a neat freak? says she as she organizes her books alphabetically by color),  and buying a house.  Also going [to](http://koozeedoo.com/) [all](http://www.barbuzzo.com/barbuzzo/) [of](http://www.bindibyob.com/bindi/) [the](http://www.buddakan.com/) [really](http://www.yangmingrestaurant.com/) [good](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-75-philadelphia) r[estaurants](http://www.whitedog.com/) [in](http://www.zahavrestaurant.com/) [Philly](http://philadelphia.menupages.com/restaurants/villa-di-roma/).

In the meantime, we&#8217;re going to Vegas.

Later!
