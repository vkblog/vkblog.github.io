[Remember this](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/01/22/facebooks-algorithm-is-still-off/)? It&#8217;s still happening.

Damnit, Facebook, get with the program.  Do you realize that I see this man every day and that we know much more than we&#8217;d like to know about each other already?  There is not more news I could possibly share with him.  Unless&#8230;that news is about my work day.  It&#8217;s true, that, unfortunately, neither Mr. B nor I work from home and don&#8217;t see each other for eight whole hours,  meaning that Facebook might be on to something!

Alright, you rouge, two can play that game.
