Mr. B loves Audrey Hepburn.  Has seen every single one of her movies.  He loves her because she&#8217;s &#8220;the only classy and beautiful actress of the modern era&#8221; and has &#8220;redefined  what being a woman means.&#8221;

We were re-watching Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s today.  I can understand why he likes her.  We have a striking resemblance both in physique and personality.
