Last weekend, I was in Ikea, as I have been every weekend for the past year of my life since we bought this house to practice good old American consumerism (except for when <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/06/29/i-almost-died-for-a-250-discount-on-an-ikea-chair/" target="_blank">I&#8217;m out on the streets</a>). I was browsing their art section because we still have almost no art in the living room and bedrooms.  We have some good stuff in the kitchen, though.  This one&#8217;s my favorite:

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Anyway, so I was at Ikea and I saw this poster:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-07-at-7.47.28-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6525" title="Screen shot 2012-03-07 at 7.47.28 AM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-07-at-7.47.28-AM.png" alt="" width="493" height="349" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I mean, I&#8217;m sure you all have seen this poster, somewhere, in a million iterations.  In fact, if you go Etsy and type in Audrey Hepburn, the Etsy search engine will just say, &#8220;I give up.  I can&#8217;t do this, man.  Everything on this site is Audrey.&#8221; Because there are Audrey posters and Audrey onsies and, yes an <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/89294387/audrey-hepburn-flask-pink-background?ref=sr_gallery_24&sref=&ga_search_submit=&ga_search_query=audrey+hepburn&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_ship_to=US&ga_page=2&ga_search_type=handmade&ga_facet=handmade" target="_blank">Audrey Hepburn flask.</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Even Mr. B, <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/04/26/why-we-all-sometimes-need-a-roman-holiday/" target="_blank">Audrey&#8217;s biggest fan</a>, hates these prints and will not buy them out of the principle that they&#8217;re super-tacky.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And it got me to thinking, what if <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/03/30/breakfast-at-boykis/" target="_blank">Audrey Hepburn</a> really hated having her picture taken? I mean, we don&#8217;t really know her true personality beyond a couple of quotes, right?  What if she was massively anti-social? And also hated black and white? And was more interested in her humanitarian work than the fact that she &#8220;believed in pink,&#8221; which almost of these prints talk about?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  What if she&#8217;s in heaven or Tiffany&#8217;s right now, all like, &#8220;Goddamn those consumerist assholes that think that a print of me will add glamour to their cookie-cutter suburban houses? They wouldn&#8217;t know glamour if it hit them over the head with a Blahnik.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I can just picture her, sitting on a cloud, smoking a cigarette and talking to God.   &#8220;You know, I did so much for the orphans in Somalistan, but no one cares since they can just slap a quote that I said offhandedly once about believing in fairy tales on their wall.&#8221; She passes the cigarette to God.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Sorry, I really didn&#8217;t mean to design you that way,&#8221; God says, taking a drag. &#8220;It&#8217;s just that people are morons and they need to have the not so pretty stuff packaged up in a pretty way and I thought if I made you pretty but also involved in UNICEF and shit, that they would get the message.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s not how it worked out, did it,&#8221; Audrey says, frowning, picking out a piece of cloud out of her LBD.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Oh well,&#8221; God says, with a shrug. &#8220;I tried.&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Might as well make that your epitaph,&#8221; Audrey says, rolling her big, darling eyes.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Then she takes a swig out of her Audrey flask.
