I was debating on whether or not I should post this.  But, ok.  Here it is, the latest find from SKRUG: a car with a front European license plate (of course) that has a Russian flag and says &#8220;Yolka,&#8221; which means either fir tree (like the kind you have for your [New Year tree](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/12/20/russian-new-year-crib-notes/)) or a nickname of some sort. I can imagine some tall, skinny guy in the Russian mafia being like, &#8220;Yeah. They call me Yolka cause I&#8217;ve done so many needles. &#8221;

Nothing says LOOKATMELOOKATME like this license plate+car combo.

So I looked at it.

P.S. If this is your car, I would like a ride.
