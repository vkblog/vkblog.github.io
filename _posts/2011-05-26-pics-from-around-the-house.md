I cannot tell you how excited I am to be typing this from my iMac, which now has a temporary table. That I can put my camera on! And upload pictures! Praise Bahá&#8217;u&#8217;lláh.

Ok. Here we go.

Here&#8217;s a lawn gnome that my mom got me as a present.  Because I think lawn gnomes are creepy and I love them. And because she thinks that Mr. B and I are huge NERDS.  It&#8217;s not an inaccurate assessment, but it still stings.

Here&#8217;s my grandpa assessing our bedroom color. He didn&#8217;t have too many kind words for it, either.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Mr. B assuming his natural position in our empty, empty living room.<br /> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/05/DSC_0496.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5012" title="DSC_0496" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/05/DSC_0496.jpg" alt="" width="531" height="353" /></a>
</p>

But then we got a couch! But the legs don&#8217;t fit, so we have to sit on it on the floor. It&#8217;s a hipster couch. Doesn&#8217;t matter. Mr. B will sit on the hipster couch.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Oh, and this is part of my kitchen.  Most finished room to date. And yes, I picked the orange color.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And I love it.  It&#8217;s better when there are lots of people, lots of food, and lots of pretty flowers in it.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Last, this is me and my friend Mr. Roller. By the end, we weren&#8217;t really friends anymore.
