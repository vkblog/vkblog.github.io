This is Horace. He&#8217;s the household&#8217;s money manager. 

&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you bought that,&#8221; Mr. B said in dismay, fresh on his new minimalist attitude after our last move. 

&#8220;Oh, he will save us lots of change that&#8217;s otherwise laying around the house&#8221; , I said.

&#8220;You just bought him because he&#8217;s cute,&#8221; Mr. B snarked.

Yes. &#8220;No,&#8221; I demurred.

But now he sits on Mr. B&#8217;s desk as his &#8220;coding buddy&#8221;.

So, ha.
