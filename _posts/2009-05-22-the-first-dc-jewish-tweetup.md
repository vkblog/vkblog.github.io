Frustrated by the sense of isolation from the Jewish community in Washington DC and also because I was jealous of the Tel Aviv Beer-Up, I decided to see if there was interest in having a Jewish tweetup around here.  @Awapy felt exactly the same, and, being in marketing, went to work. Whereas I had the vision, she created a bunch of press releases and tirelessly reached out to Jewish organizations.  She was the Weizmann to my Herzl.

[@Awapy](http://www.twitter.com/awapy) decided to put the hashtag on her back&#8230;in case anyone got lost.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-390" title="dsc01443" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01443.jpg" alt="dsc01443" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01443.jpg)

Hooray, it&#8217;s some ladies from [@the RAC,](http://twitter.com/TheRAC) one of whom is [@KatyComeTrue](http://www.twitter.com/katiecometrue).

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-391" title="dsc01444" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01444.jpg" alt="dsc01444" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01444.jpg)

And [@aimster215](http://twitter.com/aimster215).  She regaled us with her tales of Tokyo.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-392" title="dsc01445" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01445.jpg" alt="dsc01445" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01445.jpg)

Oh my.  It&#8217;s Mr. B and @Awapy.  Mr. B is not on Twitter.  Yet.   We&#8217;ll grind him down.  Eventually.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-393" title="dsc01446" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01446.jpg" alt="dsc01446" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01446.jpg)

And then [@HeebinDc](http://www.twitter.com/heebindc) and his friend, Kel-Kel came by.   She&#8217;s not on Twitter, either.  Yet.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-394" title="dsc01448" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01448.jpg" alt="dsc01448" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01448.jpg)

@Awapy and [@16thstreetj](http://www.twitter.com/16thstreetj).  He had free swag, so we liked him right away.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-396" title="dsc01449" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01449.jpg" alt="dsc01449" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01449.jpg)

@Awapy and [@16thstreetj](http://www.twitter.com/16thstreetj).  He had free swag, so we liked him right away.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-396" title="dsc01449" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01449.jpg" alt="dsc01449" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01449.jpg)

And then](http://twitter.com/julieminevich) showed up.  She is a social media goddess.  I tried to ger her to tell me her trade secrets, but then got distracted.  With a rum and Coke.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-397" title="dsc01450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01450.jpg" alt="dsc01450" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01450.jpg)

And then, all of a sudden, [@BuberZionist](http://www.twitter.com/buberzionist) showed up.  He&#8217;s a pretty nice guy. We didn&#8217;t talk a lot about politics, surprisingly.  Also, by this time, I was well into my first drink.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-398" title="dsc01451" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01451.jpg" alt="dsc01451" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01451.jpg)

@Awapy seems to be in a lot of these pictures.  Hmmm.  But here&#8217;s [@jfoodgeek](http://www.twitter.com/jfoodgeek), the craziest Arjewtinian I&#8217;ve met (also the only one) and [@RobinYasinow](http://www.twitter.com/robinyasinow), who has her own business.  I asked her a ton of questions about it.  I hope I didn&#8217;t scare her.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-399" title="dsc01453" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01453.jpg" alt="dsc01453" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01453.jpg)

Yay.  It&#8217;s [@chavalahh](http://www.twitter.com/chavalahh), who has a sweet editorial gig.  And a lady whose name I completely forget (Susan,I think) who is not on Twitter, but everyone told her she should be.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-401" title="dsc01454" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01454.jpg" alt="dsc01454" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01454.jpg)

And then there&#8217;s [@peelapom](http://www.twitter.com/peelapom).  She incorporates elements of paganism and Wiccan tradition into Judaism.  She is cool.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-402" title="dsc01457" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01457.jpg" alt="dsc01457" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01457.jpg)We look like we&#8217;re having a pretty ok time.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403" title="dsc01452" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01452.jpg" alt="dsc01452" width="480" height="360" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2009/05/dsc01452.jpg)Oh yeah, then there was that.  It says We Love Jewlicious.  But not because we&#8217;re suckups or anything.
