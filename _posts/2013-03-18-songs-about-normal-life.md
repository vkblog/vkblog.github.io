I like to listen to Jay-Z and Kanye West, because my life is nothing like theirs.  The closest I will get to a Ferrari is <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2013/01/you-cant-understand-a-man-until-you-cruise-a-mile-in-his-beemer/" target="_blank">renting a BMW</a>, and the closest I will get to being Kim Kardashian is reading <a href="http://yerevanmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Yerevan</a> Magazine.   But sometimes, you don&#8217;t want to listen to songs that say &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L53gjP-TtGE" target="_blank">My furs is Mongolian</a>/ my ice brought the goalies in,&#8221; no matter how much rhetorical talent Kanye admittedly has. Sometimes you don&#8217;t want to be reminded that Kanye&#8217;s single <a href="http://rapgenius.com/Game-jesus-piece-lyrics" target="_blank">Jesus piece</a> is the cost of your MBA.  That sometimes is usually when you&#8217;re paying your semester tuition bill.

Sometimes you just want to listen to songs about people like you, which is why Thrift Shop is so popular right now. America has been on a Cristal hangover since 2008, and we somehow can&#8217;t seem to get over it, no matter how many glasses of water we drink or how much Pepto Bismol we take.  We&#8217;ve woken up to find our wallet empty and our hand in a Wendy&#8217;s drivethrough bag (mmmm Frosty). We need a lot of energy to get through that Sunday, and we need support from our musicians.

Here they are (most have NSFW lyrics because, they, they are rap songs):

Everyday Normal Guy



My Volvo



Drink in My Hand



YOLO



Whatever You Like
  


This is why I brunch



And, of course:



Any that I missed?
