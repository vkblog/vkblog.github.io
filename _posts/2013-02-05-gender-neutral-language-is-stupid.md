      There are some things I hate with a passion. February comes to mind.  Another is gender-neutral language.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Sometime maybe 30 years ago, someone decided that the pronouns we&#8217;ve been using for centuries to express ourselves in English are Not Good Enough, and that <a href="http://lib.scnu.edu.cn/ngw/ngw/xwbk/The%20Gendering%20of%20Language%20A%20Comparison%20of%20Gender%20Equality%20in%20Countries%20with%20Gendered%20%20Natural%20Gender%20and%20Genderless%20Languages.pdf" target="_blank">womyn need equality in writing, too</a>, and as a result, we get sentences like,
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It&#8217;s better to ask your doctor; she&#8217;ll tell you that you have encephalytis.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      or
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        When approaching your boss, better catch her on a good day so she&#8217;ll give you a massive raise and a bottle of fine Dom Perignon.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      or
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Every one should know his or her telephone number in case the aliens come and have 4G and LTE.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

      This has been going on more and more ever since I was in middle school, and I still can&#8217;t get used to it. That&#8217;s over 15 years of reading this crap, and every time I see it somewhere, it throws me out of my natural rhythm of reading and into a bout of rage.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As a womyn with interest in <a href="https://vkblog.github.io/2010/02/accidental-chicken-tikka-masala-or-recipe-websites-are-awful/" target="_blank">womyn&#8217;s issues</a>, I am not at all interested in the &#8220;gendering of language.&#8221; Because I have a brain and have English reading context,  I assume that when you say &#8220;he,&#8221; you mean everyone. When you say mankind, you don&#8217;t just mean the half that has man parts.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Otherwise, if you fill in stupid he/she crap, I&#8217;m going to assume that you assume that I&#8217;m stupid, have a weak small brain, and can&#8217;t extrapolate from your sentence what you mean. Because I&#8217;m a woman.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Writers, bloggers, blaughers, tweeters, copy editors, journalists, tumblrs. Please. Revert to the normal use of the language.

      And let&#8217;s move on to the actual<a href="http://blog.jaclynday.com/post/41362731842/for-several-months-we-had-worked-out-a-childcare" target="_blank"> important topics</a> that matter to women.
