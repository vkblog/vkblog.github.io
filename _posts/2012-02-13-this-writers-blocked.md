I&#8217;ve been trying to write something that succinctly wraps up and analyzes our time in Scotland for over three weeks now. It has to be pithy, historically accurate, funny and interesting at the same time, so I am not getting anywhere.  All of my writing and thinking energy has been going to that.

In the meantime, might I interest you in <a href="http://blogs.forward.com/blognik-beat/150924/" target="_blank">Blognik Beat</a> over at the Forward, <a href="http://blogs.forward.com/blognik-beat/151154/" target="_blank">where I am complaining</a>, but for a wider audience?

Also, enjoy some of my favorite posts from the archives and this picture of a very Scottish man I saw on the train last week.
