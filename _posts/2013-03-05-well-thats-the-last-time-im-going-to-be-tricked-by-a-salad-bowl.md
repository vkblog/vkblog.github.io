As you may be aware, I like <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2012/07/things-my-husband-will-not-let-my-buy-on-etsy/" target="_blank">to buy shit online</a>.Especially for the house.

There is nothing more exciting than buying shit online, except buying shit online that you&#8217;re psychologically motivated into buying by the combination of never-ending innovation of American consumerist practices and <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2012/12/pinteresting/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>.

In this case, I&#8217;m talking about O<a href="https://www.onekingslane.com/" target="_blank">ne King&#8217;s Lane</a>. Those of you who read &#8220;shelter&#8221; blogs may be familiar with this website, which was started-up several years ago with the sole purpose of separating 20-45-year-old women from their money by putting pretty things up on the site and selling them at supposedly aggressive prices, but <a href="http://crashcut.com/post/23258569113/similarly-one-kings-lane-has-a-business-model" target="_blank">making the whole experience auction-like</a>, <a href="http://www.onlineeconomy.org/beyond-discounted-pillows-how-one-kings-lane-will-stay-on-top" target="_blank">adding a sense of urgency </a>to your chevron-towel buying frenzy.

I never joined  this site because I was waiting until I was on Mr. B&#8217;s all-clear list to buy things. As you can surmise, that moment never came, but this winter did, and boy was it depressing, and boy, wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to join this site-JUST TO LOOK FOR INSPIRATIONAL IDEAS- and oh, look! I already have my credit card information in there.

Every day, those bastards send you an email with carefully-curated collections of shit you can buy:

I don&#8217;t even LIKE the sea, and I want that coastal charm, damnit! I WANT THAT SAD STARFISH CANDLE HOLDER.

So it started very casually, because <a href="http://www.thenester.com/2011/01/how-to-shop-at-one-kings-lane-and-get-great-things-but-not-spend-all-of-your-money.html" target="_blank">I learned from the pros</a> that One Kings Lane is all about comparison shopping and waiting and sales and all that  yawn-yawn frugal stuff that led us out of the Great Depression.

This recession is not going to be ended through hard work and spending consciousness. It&#8217;s going to end with me buying something from One Kings Lane.  The problem is, that shit is EXPENSIVE. Like, crazy expensive. Case in point:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-05-at-7.55.08-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-8438" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-05 at 7.55.08 AM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-05-at-7.55.08-AM-580x322.png" width="522" height="290" /></a>
</p>

THIS MIRROR COSTS ALMOST $500. This shower curtain is $200. THAT&#8217;S ALMOST HOW MUCH MY LIFE IS WORTH.

So, I waited like a shark. Finally, I noticed something that I actually needed and that seemed well-priced, a salad bowl. I&#8217;ve been wanting a wooden salad bowl for a while, because I am yuppie and middle class, and this is the height of my earthly aspirations:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-04-at-11.06.32-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-8439" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-04 at 11.06.32 PM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-04-at-11.06.32-PM-580x262.png" width="522" height="236" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This salad bowl cost $29, plus shipping, but if you think about it, it was $16 off, so really, I reasoned with Mr. B, it was like we were saving money. I looked it up on the artist&#8217;s Etsy site; looked legit. Also, it&#8217;s colorful.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  After all of the final taxes, the salad bowl came out to $42(!). But it&#8217;s worth it if you&#8217;re going to use it for generations, right?  I waited for weeks for my salad bowl.  When they finally said it shipped, I bought some salad in anticipation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Then the salad bowl came:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-05-at-8.00.33-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8440" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-05 at 8.00.33 AM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-05-at-8.00.33-AM.png" width="315" height="411" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Correct, it&#8217;s the size of my hand.  Here&#8217;s another picture, of Mr. B&#8217;s disapproving face in proportion to said salad bowl:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-05-at-8.00.46-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8441" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-05 at 8.00.46 AM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-05-at-8.00.46-AM.png" width="316" height="412" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I can&#8217;t even look at that picture anymore. I feel like he&#8217;s still judging me. Which he is.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  To be fair, the product description did say 7 inches. But how was I supposed to know that seven inches is not enough for salad?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Here&#8217;s the picture on the artist&#8217;s site. Very salad-y and ful of leafy greens, amirite?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-04-at-11.06.25-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8446" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-04 at 11.06.25 PM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-04-at-11.06.25-PM-580x387.png" width="580" height="387" /></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I was depressed for all of last night.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I tried to think of some uses for my overpriced yuppie salad bowl.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I came up with only one:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-05-at-8.03.09-AM.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8442" alt="Screen shot 2013-03-05 at 8.03.09 AM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2013/03/Screen-shot-2013-03-05-at-8.03.09-AM.png" width="327" height="415" /></a>
</p>

Correct. Next time you come over to my house, you can eat one piece of fruit from the salad bowl.

Thanks, capitalism!
