As I was curled up in the fetal position on the floor yesterday (true story), Mr. B rolled his eyes and told me to get up.

&#8220;I&#8217;m a bad writer,&#8221; I wailed.

&#8220;No, you&#8217;re just not writing what you really mean.  You&#8217;re self-censoring again.&#8221;

&#8220;I have to throw this whole thing out and start over,&#8221; I moaned.

Mr. B rolled his eyes again.

&#8220;Ok, I&#8217;m going to scratch out the introduction and write three more introductions, and you tell me which one you like more,&#8221; I said, resolutely.

I wrote three more introductions.  It was a painful exercise.

&#8220;I like the third one,&#8221; he said.

&#8220;But it&#8217;s just the best out of the four.  Not the best one,&#8221; I slumped in my chair.  Then I got up and went to lay on the floor again.

Mr. B rolled his eyes for the third time.

&#8220;Just write what you really mean.  What you really mean is xxx, xxxx, and xxxxx.  So write, &#8216;xxxxxxx,xxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxx and xxxxx and xxxxx, xxxxxxxxx.'&#8221;

I stared at him.

&#8220;How did you do that?  I&#8217;ve been struggling with this intro sentence for two weeks.  And you just pulled it out of me in five minutes.&#8221;

Then I got off the floor and rewrote the first sentence.  And then the sentence after that.  And the sentence after that.

Basically what I&#8217;m saying is that Mr. B is <a href="http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/16071783/lit/bradstre.htm" target="_blank">Simon Bradstreet.</a>

Also, being whiny on the floor is really uncomfortable.
