&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to write for my next post,&#8221; I told Mr. B, scratching my head.

&#8220;Write something cute about me, &#8221; Mr. B said wryly, watching the [Freemason&#8217;s Remix of Ring the Alarm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk4fBAMIFBU) for the 10th time today.

Here is a list of cute things about Mr. B that I could think of in 10 minutes, or until my Twitter-addled attention span moved on to Perez Hilton.

  * He demands [kasha](http://bangusbelly.blogspot.com/2007/08/looking-for-grechnevaya-kasha.html) for breakfast because it reminds him of kindergarten in Russia
  * He peels my oranges for me and cuts my watermelon, because I never learned how to cut watermelon properly.
  * He knows everything there is to know about tennis and is probably a better tennis commentator than John McEnroe
  * He reads physics books for fun and works through the exercises as well.
  * He likes McIntosh Apples. He does not like Granny Smith apples as much, which are the kind I like. We are a two-apple household.

Sorry, it&#8217;s been a slow brainstorming day.

Here&#8217;s your Friday Link lineup:
