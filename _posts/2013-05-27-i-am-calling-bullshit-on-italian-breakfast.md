I&#8217;m in Italy and I figured I&#8217;d get this out there before I forget how angry I am right now once I get back to a country where IHOP is a constitutional right.

Italian breakfast food is bullshit.

The pasta and the bruschetta and the carbs are all delicious. I have never eaten such fresh and delicious food in my entire life except for all Israeli food ever.

But that&#8217;s dinner. You have to make it to dinner alive.

We&#8217;ve been in Italy for four days and I WANT SOME BREAKFAST FOOD.  Waffles, pancakes, eggs, cereal, something. Please, God, even fruit. Even yogurt. Anything. A single corn flake. I&#8217;ll eat it off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples_waste_management_issue" target="_blank">the floor of Naples</a> if I have to. It&#8217;s that serious.

Because what&#8217;s the other option?

This is Italian breakfast.

Ready?

You blinked. You missed it.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tancro/5668793409/sizes/m/in/photostream/" target="_blank">Here it is again</a>.

It&#8217;s the leftover part of your brother&#8217;s  muffin and the remaints of the extra-extra-super-small of whatever they give you at Starbucks. This cannot be more than 300 calories. Probably up to 320 if you eat the cappuccino foam. Which I&#8217;m doing, because after you eat this, you have to walk 6-7 miles a day.  You need that foam.

Oh! I forgot to mention you can also compliment your coffee with a cigarette, which is great, except that Mr. B and I are non-smokers, so we end up chewing our nails for the extra protein.

And can you buy breakfast at the supermarket? Yes! They are open from 9:30 or whenever they feel like it, which is usually after the time you leave to do stuff for the day. So basically, eat a big dinner, because otherwise, Slimfast.

Please, someone give me a single scrambled egg.

God bless America, land of the brunch.
