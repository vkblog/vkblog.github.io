Trying it the <a href="http://nextdraft.com/" target="_blank">Dave Pell</a> way today:

  Peretz Partensky was born in Ekaterinburg, lived in Boston, got bored, and <a href="http://nplusonemag.com/basketball-diaries-afghanistan" target="_blank">decided to go work</a> as a network admin in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. This story is about how he tried to coach the local basketball team. For <a href="http://www.tolerableinsanity.com/blog/2010/06/andijon-uzbekistan-to-osh-kyrgyzstan/" target="_blank">added bonus material,</a> his photoessay about the Ferghana Valley in Uzbekistan. For even more, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Bvy6U" target="_blank">some pictures from a hot spring</a> in the Hindu Kush.  ALSO, <a href="http://ivorypomegranate.com/2012/11/29/a-no-baby-yet-update/" target="_blank">file this under</a> women who fly 7 months pregnant from Kyrgysztan to the U.S.

&#8220;I&#8217;m single, unemployed and living back at my parents&#8217; house in my 30s. I&#8217;d rather hug a pine tree naked than field questions about my life to semi-strangers in a holiday party scenario,&#8221; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anna-goldfarb/i-used-to-enjoy-holiday-parties_b_2246151.html" target="_blank">writes Philadelphian columnist</a> Anna Goldfarb.

  Who should be reading this blog post about <a href="http://corporette.com/2012/11/28/tales-from-the-wallet-who-manages-the-money-in-your-house" target="_blank">who manages money in the household?</a> Banks. Women manage a lot more than men, yet every financial vehicle is marketed to men.

Jason Kottke has a r<a href="http://kottke.org/12/12/made-in-the-usa-is-back-baby" target="_blank">oundup of recent articles</a> about the manufacturing mini-boom in America, starting with Farhad Manjoo&#8217;s take on how AMAZING American Giant is. Not gonna lie, I definitely checked out their site afterwards, only to find out the shirts are for men only. BOO.

  Paul Ford is my favorite living essayist. <a href="https://medium.com/fords-sensorium/ba2015763500" target="_blank">In this one</a> on n<a href="https://medium.com/about/9e53ca408c48" target="_blank">ew blogging platform Medium</a> backed by twitter founder Ev Williams, he explores the difference between realtime in 2012, and realtime during D-Day.

I saw Nassim Taleb speak this week. It was one of the best things I&#8217;ve seen in my life. <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/nov/24/nassim-taleb-antifragile-finance-interview" target="_blank">Reading this essay</a> about his contrarian, but almost 100% correct ideas, is almost like that.

  There are a bunch of end-of-year book recommendation lists. I&#8217;m not going to tell you which one is the best (mine which I haven&#8217;t written yet), but here they are. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.themigrantbookclub.com/2012/11/the-migrant-bookclubs-2012-best-books.html" target="_blank">one from Petya</a>, who has great taste. T<a href="http://www.themillions.com/" target="_blank">he Millions</a> is doing A Year in Reading by some famous people. <a href="http://www.openroadmedia.com/romancematrix" target="_blank">This one</a> is if you like romance novels.  And the <a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/tob/" target="_blank">Morning News</a> tournament of books is coming up.

Saudi Arabia sounds like <a href="http://susiesbigadventure.blogspot.com/2012/12/in-support-of-saudi-women-and-hardees.html" target="_blank">a generally ridiculous place to live</a>. Susie tries to be very diplomatic about it.

  Let&#8217;s talk <a href="http://thehairpin.com/2012/12/what-will-they-name-the-baby" target="_blank">about the Royal Baby</a>. A lot. As much as you want.

I have a friend who recently went to Mozambique because it was &#8220;untouristy.&#8221; It&#8217;s about to get a lot more touristy and crowded, now <a href="http://robertamsterdam.com/2012/12/boom-times-for-mozambique/" target="_blank">that oil&#8217;s been discovered.</a>

  Communism was super-weird, and for some reason Westerners love to fixate on the &#8220;sci-fi&#8221; buildings it built. Here is <a href="http://www.theawl.com/2012/12/the-sublime-sci-fi-buildings-that-communism-built" target="_blank">an annotated essay</a>.

<a href="http://shortformblog.com/post/36820647205/nate-silver-took-part-in-an-authors-google" target="_blank">Nate Silver</a>, my next husband, gave a hour-long-ish talk at Google recently on Data and Life. He is 100% correct that democratization of data is the only way forward.

  Freakonomics has covered this before, but here is an actual account of discrimination based on how ethnic your name sounds <a href="http://www.xojane.com/issues/so-much-for-equal-opportunity-employment" target="_blank">from a woman who&#8217;s applied to 37 jobs.</a>  For not the first time, I&#8217;m super-glad my parents didn&#8217;t go for Svetlana like their original goal was.
