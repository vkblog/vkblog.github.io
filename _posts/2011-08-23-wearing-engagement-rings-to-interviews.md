<a href="http://www.facebook.com/susqhb" target="_blank">Suzanne</a> posted a link from Huffpo advising women <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/katherine-bindley/interviewing-should-you-take-the-ring-off_b_930242.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009" target="_blank">not to wear engagement rings</a> to interviews.

To which I said,

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5654" title="Screen shot 2011-08-23 at 7.20.50 AM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-23-at-7.20.50-AM.png" alt="" width="428" height="104" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-23-at-7.20.50-AM.png)

And trust me, I&#8217;ve interviewed A LOT over the past year.

And to which people replied, basically, &#8220;Don&#8217;t give other people a reason to judge you.&#8221; Although there was one HR pro that said she didn&#8217;t give a crap.

But is this really a problem?  Honestly? Or just another way to give women anxiety about how they present themselves in the workplace and filler for the HuffPo writer? But then I dug deep (aka did a 5-second Google search) and found out that <a href="http://boards.weddingbee.com/topic/engagement-ring-to-an-interview" target="_blank">other women </a> <a href="http://forum.purseblog.com/career-and-workplace/should-women-wear-engagement-rings-to-interviews-700328-3.html" target="_blank">are crazy</a> and insecure, too.

But then I found <a href="http://thegloss.com/career/huffpo-wonders-whether-women-should-wear-engagement-rings-to-job-interviews/" target="_blank">this comment</a>:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5655" title="Screen shot 2011-08-23 at 7.26.34 AM" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-23-at-7.26.34-AM.png" alt="" width="681" height="159" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-23-at-7.26.34-AM.png)

and it made me wonder. Do men really look at women this way sometimes? Do women look at women this way sometimes?

The world sucks, man.
