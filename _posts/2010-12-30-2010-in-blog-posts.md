I just looked through my archives and realized I wrote some pretty great stuff in 2010. I even did the Photoshops!  But then it all somehow went wrong and by the end of the year I was an emo mess posting pictures of the full moon and Skype chats with Mr. B.  Here&#8217;s hoping 2011 finds us together again and that Mr. B brings the mojo I accidentally left behind in D.C. with him.

2011 is the [year of the rabbit](http://www.theholidayspot.com/chinese_new_year/more_zodiacs/rabbit.htm), which means it&#8217;s supposed to be much more relaxing than this year, which was the tiger.  I wish all of my (three?) blog readers health, love, and relaxation for next year.  We all need it before the apocalypse comes in 2012.

Here&#8217;s my year in blogging:

I talk about [a teacher who inspired me](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/01/19/mrs-bej-and-bellydancing-after-the-saudi-arabian-embassy/).
