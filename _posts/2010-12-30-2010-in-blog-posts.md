I just looked through my archives and realized I wrote some pretty great stuff in 2010. I even did the Photoshops!  But then it all somehow went wrong and by the end of the year I was an emo mess posting pictures of the full moon and Skype chats with Mr. B.  Here&#8217;s hoping 2011 finds us together again and that Mr. B brings the mojo I accidentally left behind in D.C. with him.

2011 is the [year of the rabbit](http://www.theholidayspot.com/chinese_new_year/more_zodiacs/rabbit.htm), which means it&#8217;s supposed to be much more relaxing than this year, which was the tiger.  I wish all of my (three?) blog readers health, love, and relaxation for next year.  We all need it before the apocalypse comes in 2012.

Here&#8217;s my year in blogging:

**January**
  
 [We attend a baby naming ceremony](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/01/31/millions-of-babies-the-holocaust-and-gender-segregation-its-the-weekend/) and are kind of called Nazis.
  
I talk about [a teacher who inspired me](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/01/19/mrs-bej-and-bellydancing-after-the-saudi-arabian-embassy/).
  
We go [horseback riding](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/01/18/riding-a-horse-is-like-blogging-except-you-cant-become-a-parapalegic-if-you-blog/) and I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to become a parapalegic.
  
[This month&#8217;s feminist controvers](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/01/04/is-it-feminism-to-pose-naked-with-a-challah/)y!

**February**

I [am still working on my novel](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/02/18/im-going-to-fire-my-editor/). (And still am!)
  
You [people take pity on me](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/02/15/accidental-chicken-tikka-masala-or-recipe-websites-are-awful/) and shower me with advice.
  
I explain [how cheap we are](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/02/10/the-history-of-tipping-in-the-boykis-household/) in infographics.

I put a bunch of people [on notice](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/03/17/on-notice/).
  
Also [we almost go to India](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/03/15/whoever-said-life-is-about-adventure-and-risk-taking-never-had-typhoid-shots/) but not really.

**April**

[We move](https://vkblog.github.io/2010/04/14/welcome-to-the-bardak-that-is-my-apartment/), for the first but not last time in 2010.
