If you are a fellow Special Pretty Princess (also known as &#8220;creative type&#8221; ), you know that sometimes your  craft goes easier if you are playing music.

When I was writing <a href="http://ebook.vickiboykis.com" target="_blank">my ebook</a>, I often worked really early in the morning, right before a full day of  thinking intensely at work, and late at night, right after a full day of thinking intensely at work, and, on Mondays, in class.

So I needed music to not only push me through, but to get me in the right frame of mind to write.  Unfortunately for Mr. B, with whom I share the office, the music was a playlist of about 50 songs that I could loop through infinitely. It was Scottish folk songs. Also, remixes of Scottish folk songs. Also, Enya.

Oh, how Mr. B suffered.

At first, he was ok with it.

&#8220;Anything to push you through to the end,&#8221; he said brightly as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfydebZ9-78" target="_blank">Annie Laurie</a> played in the background.

&#8220;Ok, looks like you&#8217;re really writing,&#8221; he said, hesitating slightly as the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_HaNpsEv1w&feature=related" target="_blank">Scottish MegaMix</a> looped through a third time.  (Although I have a discerning and classy eye for literature and design, I have an embarrassingly Russian love of techno music.)

&#8220;Oh my God it&#8217;s this song again,&#8221; he said as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUXeosPR9ic" target="_blank">Scottish Rain</a> came on again.  Yes, this song really does exist and after the first month of about ten plays a day, Mr. B was singing this song like a textbook case of Stockholm Syndrome.

But somewhere in the middle of month two, he cracked.

&#8220;You HAVE to put on headphones,&#8221; he said in desperation in the middle of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ7f0HUk8OU" target="_blank">Loch Lomond</a>.

&#8220;But it&#8217;s my pushing code song,&#8221; <a href="http://blog.news.me/post/19237649258/ah-push-it-the-push-music-behind-19-startups" target="_blank">I protested.</a> (I was in a startup frame of mind.)

&#8220;No one in the history of anything has EVER pushed code to Loch Lomond,&#8221; said Mr. B and sadly left the room.

Between the playlist, the neglect of the house, <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2012/04/sad-fridge-is-sad/" target="_blank">the empty refrigerator</a>, and the piles of teacups and manuscripts everywhere, I&#8217;m actually not sure I&#8217;m even married anymore. Even if I was, I can&#8217;t find Mr. B. I think  the huge tumbleweeds gently rolling through our living room ate him.

Now that I&#8217;m slowly clawing my way back to reality, maybe I should check.

Guess what, though?  <a href="http://grooveshark.com/playlist/There+s+Something+About+This+Playlist/69572560" target="_blank">You can listen to the playlist, too!</a>  But make sure that if you&#8217;re married you hide your marriage certificate. Just in case.

P.S. Right now I am listening to 0 songs on that playlist.  I&#8217;ve even worn myself down. Instead, I really like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHEOF_rcND8&ob=av3e" target="_blank">this song</a>.
