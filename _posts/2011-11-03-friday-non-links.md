Instead of Friday Links, here&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been gone all week.

**Monday:** <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/10/31/razor-blades-in-candy-basically-a-myth-professor-says/" target="_blank">Trick-or-treaters</a> come. First time at our house! Thank God, because I bought some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004N5KU9Y/ref=oh_o05_s00_i01_details" target="_blank">bulk amount of candy</a> on Amazon since <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/07/12/this-post-about-how-i-guilt-buy-febreeze-on-amazon-is-going-to-be-a-goldmine-for-marketers/" target="_blank">I&#8217;m too lazy to go to the store</a> and I&#8217;ve b<a href="http://www.someecards.com/halloween-cards/halloween-candy-sugar-obesity-kids-trick-or-treat" target="_blank">een kind of eating it</a> for the past three weeks. You&#8217;re welcome. But you know what? American kids are rude.  They never say thank you for candy.  I swear all those kids need is 10 days in Russia. 3 if it&#8217;s Siberia.  Also, spin class in the middle. <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/4184/saturday-night-live-pumping-up-with-hans-and-franz" target="_blank"> Spin class is terrifying.<br /> </a>**Tuesday:** <a href="http://www.georgestreetplayhouse.org/mainstage/itshouldabeenyou" target="_blank">It Shoulda Been You </a>with Mr. B&#8217;s mom in New Brunswick.  The <a href="http://www.itshouldabeenyou.com/abouttheshow.html" target="_blank">play itself </a>was pretty good and the actors were very talented and it was directed by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCMH8L6whlk&feature=related" target="_blank">Dr. Niles Crane</a>,  but also 1.5 hours away from my house, which made me want to stab myself.
  
**Wednesday:** <a href="http://www.webanalyticsassociation.org/?page=philly_symposium" target="_blank">Web Analytics Conference</a> during the day for work because my job is awesome and encourages me to go to nerd things, Anthony Bourdain at night. So good. I mean, <a href="http://www.endlesssimmer.com/2011/03/08/my-beef-with-bourdain/" target="_blank">kind of staged and calculated</a>, but still, really good.  Also squeezed in <a href="http://www.philadelphiachutneyco.com/" target="_blank">some chutney</a>!
  
**Thursday:** Ah, blessed Thursday.  Not having anything to do.  Except. Oh right. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrLzGwctOgg" target="_blank">The house is dirty</a>.
  
**Friday:**  Hopefully more of nothing. With the gym mixed in.
  
**Saturday:  I&#8217;ll **be at <a href="http://2011.philly.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Philly!</a>  Will I see you there?
