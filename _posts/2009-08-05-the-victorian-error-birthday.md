_Today is my birthday.  I&#8217;ve decided to celebrate by remembering  birthdays past, specifically my 20th birthday three years ago._

This particular birthday took place in Israel, when I was interning for [Bank HaPoalim](http://www.bankhapoalim.com/), the biggest bank in Israel and also the biggest provider of yummy after-lunch snacks in the country.  At the time, I was living with three roommates, also on the internship, and we were in a semi-contentious state.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The source of the contentiousness might have revolved around the fact that we were living in a 900-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment together.  It also might have been that all three of my roommates were more religious than me, and, therefore, became angry when I dismissed Hundred of Years of Religious Tradition to eat at non-kosher restaurants and saw wearing<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah"> kippot</a> as an inconvenience.
</p>

Nevertheless, we&#8217;d agreed previously that we&#8217;d all go out for my birthday.  Since it had been a little hard for me to accommodate to their dietary needs and miss out on great Tel Aviv eating opportunities when I was more flexible, we&#8217;d agreed to go to a place I was interested in.  The place I was interested in was a Russian restaurant, becuase, no matter which country they are in, Russian restaurants offer an authentic dining experience that I didn&#8217;t think my roommates would get anywhere else.

  <strong>The den of debauchery</strong>
</p>

The day of my birthday, we&#8217;d already gotten in several spats. One of these spats resulted from the fact that I told them the Russian restaurant might not be kosher, and who were they to regulate me on my birthday. I was feeling bitter, so I decided to start the night off early with some drinks.  For some reason, we had two bottles of vodka in the refrigerator (and not much else.)  I drank two shots.  I almost keeled over.  Tense, the four of us left.

</p>

I stumbled up the street to the Russian restaurant, roommates in tow, an angry fog forming in my brain. I decided I would ask the place about its  menu to make sure the roommates could eat there. I opened the door to the restaurant.  A wave of techno music blasted me right back out into the street.  Through my buzz, I could see well-dressed Russians looking at me like I was crazy.  The roommates followed meekly behind.  I walked up to the woman taking reservations.  &#8220;Are you a kosher restaurant,&#8221; I slurred to her, my eyes not quite focusing on the menu.

She looked at me as if I were from the moon.  Asking a Russian restaurant if they are kosher is similar to asking if they have ice cubes in hell.  She gave me the menu.  I translated aloud for my roommates&#8217; benefit.  &#8220;Pork with potatoes,&#8221; I stumbled.  &#8220;Pork with mushrooms, pork with a wine sauce.&#8221;  I slammed the menu shut with demonstrative force.

&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I wobbled bitterly, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go somewhere where you guys can eat.&#8221;  I stomped out of the restaurant.  We settled on a kosher fish restaurant.  Settling on kosher  made me feel like a loser.  Like I was settling on a Kia Sephia after test-driving a BMW.  A pork-filled BMW.   Not that I eat pork.  But the techno music would have been awesome.

We started talking about what it means to be Jewish, an excellent idea when you are half-drunk.  &#8220;I keep kosher, I pray, and I am Jewish,&#8221; said one roommate.  &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t do any of that stuff, and I&#8217;m just as Jewish as you are,&#8221; I countered, stabbing my tilapia with brutal force. &#8220;What&#8217;s more,&#8221; I added, vehemently scooping up my rice and fanning the flame with my other hand, &#8220;if I had a son, I wouldn&#8217;t circumcise him.&#8221;

The roommates looked at me. This was Unthinkable.  &#8220;Well, if you know someone who&#8217;s not circumcised, they&#8217;re not Jewish.&#8221;  I became enraged.  &#8220;Are you telling me that all my Russian friends that are soldiers, that fight for the State of Israel in the [IDF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces), but are not circumcised just because that&#8217;s not what we did in Russia, aren&#8217;t Jewish?&#8221; I asked them.

&#8220;Yes, and if you don&#8217;t observe the rituals, how does it make you a Jew?&#8221;

&#8220;Are you saying I&#8217;m not Jewish enough, just because I don&#8217;t light candles every Friday?&#8221;  My drunkenness was wearing off into a dull ache.  And not just from the tilapia.  I didn&#8217;t feel accepted, I felt marginalized, and betrayed.  Here I was, giving blood to the [Israeli version of the Red Cross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magen_David_Adom),  learning Hebrew, and volunteering to bring food to soldiers up north during the war with Lebanon, and someone had the nerve to tell me I wasn&#8217;t Jewish. And I was just mastering the [voiceless pharyngeal fricative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_pharyngeal_fricative), too.   Also, I was arguing over the fine aspects of circumcision on my birthday.

&#8220;So you&#8217;re saying that my family, who lived as Jews for hundreds of years in Russia, and were even persecuted as a result, are not Jewish,&#8221; I played with my kosher roll.

The roommates looked at me.  Probably half in fear that I would bring up circumcision again.

I got up, incensed.  I threw some shekels down to pay my bill and walked out.  The alcohol had left completely, and had been replaced with tears.  I cried and walked, and kept walking around Tel Aviv.  In retrospect, since it was about 9:00 at night, I probably could have gotten killed by a real kosher-keeping Jew.  But I didn&#8217;t care.  I sat down in a sketchy park.  I pulled out my cell phone and called Mr. B, who at that time was my boyfriend.

&#8220;My roommates think I&#8217;m not Jewish and they won&#8217;t even let me go to a Russian pork restaurant for my birthday,&#8221; I bawled.

&#8220;Screw em.  Seriously.  Screw em.  You&#8217;re the biggest Jew I know,&#8221; he said.  And he talked me down from hysteria,  at three in the morning Eastern Time.  I sat on the bench after I hung up with him and looked into the darkness. I thought I saw a serial killer, but it was only a feral cat.  I calmed down in stages, and walked back to the apartment.

I could tell my roommates felt guilty, because they&#8217;d bought me flowers. I accepted their appologies and went to sleep. I decided for myself that no one would make me feel inferior about being Jewish, just because I expressed it in a different way than them.  And it was still my birthday. I went to sleep, promising myself lots of nonkosher food  at lunch the next day.
