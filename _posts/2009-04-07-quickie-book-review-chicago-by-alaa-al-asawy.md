What it&#8217;s about: Serious Egyptian college students in America ponder their future in a post 9-11 America
  
Why it&#8217;s good: Shows multi-faceted face of Egyptian society and gives a peek into Egyptian culture, particulalry in the face of xenophobic Americans. Also tackles womens&#8217; issues in Egypt.
  
Why it&#8217;s bad: Has several indistinguishable characters and no seeming ending goal, making the reader feel deprived, author dismisses all Zionism as evil, even though Jews are supposedly &#8220;ok&#8221;
  
Moral of the book: Don&#8217;t judge all Middle Easterners in America; we are all human; people have the government they deserve
