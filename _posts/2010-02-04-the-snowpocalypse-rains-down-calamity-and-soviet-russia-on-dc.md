You probably won&#8217;t hear from me next week, because I&#8217;ll be snowed under.   You may have heard that the DC area is scheduled to be obliterated like Atlantis over the weekend [due to the snowpocalypse that will occur](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/2010/02/major_to_historic_storm.html):

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2272" title="Picture 4" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/Picture-41.png" alt="" width="504" height="321" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/Picture-41.png)

As a result, all Hell has broken loose in the DC region and [my local Giant supermarket](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/07/12/the-victorian-error-lite-jazz/) has turned into a stunning example of Soviet breadlines that my parents lived through.  I can only say, Lord have mercy on yuppies like me that have had to experience alarming shortages of Danon Extra Bacteria Yogurt. There was no milk in our store.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2273" title="breadline" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/breadline.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="336" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/breadline.jpg)

Sorry.  I mean NO ORGANIC GREEN VEGETABLES OF ANY KIND.  AND NO LOCALLY-SOURCED CUCUMBERS.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2274" title="490751752_1722983062_0.jpeg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/490751752_1722983062_0.jpeg.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="265" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/490751752_1722983062_0.jpeg.jpg)

And look at this government worker from Rockville crying into her ordinary parsley.  OH, THE HUMANITY. ONLY RED PEPPERS.  NO GREEN.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2275" title="490753698_1722990558_0.jpeg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/490753698_1722990558_0.jpeg.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="265" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/490753698_1722990558_0.jpeg.jpg)

There was only soy milk.  No regular, skim milk.  HOW WILL I SURVIVE THE SNOWPOCALYPSE?

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2276" title="490753433_1722989539_0.jpeg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/490753433_1722989539_0.jpeg.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="265" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/490753433_1722989539_0.jpeg.jpg)

And no Post cereals.  Only generic brand.  This is inhumane.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2277" title="490758080_1723007444_0.jpeg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/490758080_1723007444_0.jpeg.jpg" alt="" width="351" height="265" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/02/490758080_1723007444_0.jpeg.jpg)

Others have also noticed the horrors.

I&#8217;m with you buddy.  It was exactly like Soviet Russia.

If you don&#8217;t hear from me, I&#8217;ve perished in the yuppie food riots.
