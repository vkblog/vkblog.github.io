Today is the 50th anniversary of [Yuriy Gagarin&#8217;s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin) remarkable solo flight around the earth. [Here is a beautiful video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKs6ikmrLgg&feature=player_embedded#at=206) all about it.

What makes me really emotional is realizing just how big of an achievement it was (the fact that a bloodthirsty and totalitarian regime pushed for it does not diminish this,) and how scary and thrilling it must have been for him.

At a time when we have so much negative news from Libya, Bahrain, Egypt, Japan,Israel, bam, bam, bam every day, non-ending 24-hour news cycle,  it&#8217;s a relief to reflect on the wonders of humanity rather than the horrors.

And, hey, if [astronauts can have a work-life balance](http://lightbox.time.com/2011/04/12/first-man-in-space-vintage-soviet-propaganda-glorifying-yuri-gagarin/#4), why can&#8217;t I?
