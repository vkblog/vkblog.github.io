  * Making sure our finances are in shape as we go through our mortgage approval.
  * Learning how to take care of a house
  * Finishing my grad school application essay and just turning it in already (in PANIC MODE for this one)
  * The logistics of moving after we sign our closing papers in late April since, technically, we don&#8217;t have a bed
  * Training for [our first 5k of the year](http://jasgp.org/cherryblossomfestival/index.php/Featured-Events/5K-Run-2010.html)
  * How to get more involved and meet more people in Philly
  * Figuring out how to buy a houseful of furniture
  * Also we need a new car
