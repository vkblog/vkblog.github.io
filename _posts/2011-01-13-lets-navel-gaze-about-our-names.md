Let&#8217;s take a break from talking about OMGAsianMoms and do something fun.

Yesterday as I was snowed in, I came across this thread which asks the question: [what were you going to be named](http://www.younghouselove.com/2011/01/what-could-have-been/)? To date, it has 640 comments which means it&#8217;s struck a nerve, and I can completely understand.  Names are important for a number of reasons and many cultures, including Judaism, believe that a name will shape a child&#8217;s destiny.  Which is why I, as a Victoria, am totally mackin&#8217; it right now by living at my mother in law&#8217;s house and attending a gym where I am sure I will witness a mafia money transaction any day now.

When I was 12 and working on my first novel (a Civil War thriller about a 12-year-old girl named Georgia that lived near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania-_yes_.), I bought a baby name book and read it every day for six months, browsing the possibilities for my character.  In my writing today, I still think names are one of the most significant ways to influence a character and always tend to pick carefully.

You already know that I was named after a variety of strawberry growing in my grandmother&#8217;s garden (and also the name of a character in some book that my dad liked but can&#8217;t now remember the name of), but before that, I was going to be either Alice (Alisa in Russian) or Svetlana. Needless to say, I am 100% grateful that my parents didn&#8217;t go the Svetlana route becuase, while it&#8217;s an extremely pretty name in Russian having to do with light (_svyet_), it is impossible to pronounce in English.  If you are not a native Russian speaker, try pronouncing svyet so that it rhymes with nyet, but make sure you blur the &#8220;y&#8221; and &#8220;e&#8221; together so that it&#8217;s a single letter that produces a sound similar to the &#8220;eh&#8221; in yetti. Yeah.

But I can&#8217;t help wondering what would happen if I were an Alice. Or if I decided to go by Tori instead of Vicki? Or if I went by Victoria?  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to do the latter because, growing up in a culture that prides itself on nicknames and diminutives has made calling someone by their long name sound weird to me, even if their name is beautiful.  For example, I have never, ever, ever called Mr. B by [his full name](http://www.behindthename.com/name/daniil), and don&#8217;t even often call him by [his &#8220;full&#8221; diminutive](http://www.babynamespedia.com/meaning/Danya/m) in Russian unless I am exasperated.  Russian-speakers usually call me Vika, but my family calls me Vika, Vikusya,Vikuska, Vikush, Vikan&#8217;ka, and Vik&#8217; if they need something quickly from me.

_So, what were you (or someone you know) going to be named and were glad you weren&#8217;t? Or what do you wish you had been named instead? What is your stance on nicknames (comment carefully. All comments can and will be used against you on a playground.)?_
