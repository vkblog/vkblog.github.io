I didn&#8217;t have to do anything except go to museums in D.C.  But ever since I moved to Philly, it&#8217;s like real life found me and assaulted me. Over the past week, I&#8217;ve done the following:

  * Taken my grandpa&#8217;s watch to get his battery changed.
  * Found out battery and watch are broken, gone to store to buy grandpa new watch.
  * Whined about it.
  * Registered for the GRE to apply to grad school in Fall 2011, braced self for the possibility that I might ALSO have to take the GMAT since there is only one school with a Master&#8217;s in Econ (Temple) and if I don&#8217;t get in, it&#8217;s business school for me.
  * Whined about it.
  * Started researching new cars and saving for one.  My baby is 11 years young and starting to bleed money for repairs and although it&#8217;s thrilling to play Russian roulette with my life on 95 south, I&#8217;m kind of ready for some more stability in pleading with the fates.
  * Started researching areas where Mr. B and I want to buy a house.  We already know how much we can afford so at this point it&#8217;s all about where we can actually live.
  * Started figuring out how much more we need to save for a house versus how much we need to save for a car.
  * Started saving for furniture for the house, started planning budget for house repairs and maintenance.

And this list never ends.  Every time I cross something off, a subtask comes up. I would dump some of this stuff on Mr. B, but it&#8217;s kind of hard to plan Where Your Life Is Going over Skype, and because I am the more proactive of us (read: neurotic as hell), I decided to take control of the situation.

Besides, Mr. B is chilling in D.C. right now.  When he comes here, life is going to catch up to him as well, in the form of my to-do list for him, including resuming all of my responsibilities that I&#8217;m too lazy to do now:

  * Foot massage
  * Actually purchasing our car (because as we know, car dealers deal differently with men than women)
  * Peeling my oranges again
  * Learning how to paint and do house maintenance
  * Grocery shopping

I can&#8217;t wait until he&#8217;s as miserable as me.
