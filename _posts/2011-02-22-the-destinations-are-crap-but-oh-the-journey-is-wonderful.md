There is a Russian joke that has a man going back and forth from Odessa to Moscow, Moscow to Odessa. As soon as he gets to one place, he turns right around and goes to the other.  A man caught up to him and asked, &#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;  The man replied, &#8220;The destinations are crap, but oh, the journey is wonderful.&#8221;

I love travel, and I don&#8217;t know what it is about planes and cars and trains (not so much buses) that I love so much. But I do.  I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m reminded of how small and insignificant our problems really are as I see cars the size of ants, somber mountains, and endless clouds.

  Traveling is one of my main joys in life and wanderlust is one of my main problems. I love packing my bags. I love driving to the airport. I love how everyone in the airport is in it together. In what? I don&#8217;t know.   Mr. B says it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m part Mongolian.

  I say it&#8217;s because the journey is wonderful.

  And, if you stay tuned for my upcoming Vegas post, you&#8217;ll find out that the destinations are mostly crap.
