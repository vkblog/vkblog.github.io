_Reader(s)!  Please note that sometime over the next week I will be shifting the blog over to http://blog.vickiboykis.com to make room for a front page that doesn’t make me look like a crazed Nutella lover, a fact that people will find out only on the blog. Mwuahahaha.  Not too drastic of a change, but you’ll want to update your bookmarks. RSS shouldn’t be affected \*crosses fingers\* Danke schoen._

As I am sitting here, shivering and complaining over the cold, cold DC-area winter:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2049" title="Picture 1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/01/Picture-1.png" alt="" width="500" height="200" />](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/01/Picture-1.png)
  
my friend Efrem is studying to become a rabbi in sunny, funny Israel.  Recently, he went to Egypt over the weekend with his new wife and bunch of friends, and the pictures again had me longing to not only to travel, but to travel to somewhere exotic.

This is my favorite photo:
