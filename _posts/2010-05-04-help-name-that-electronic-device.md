My new [HTC Incredible](http://www.wired.com/reviews/product/pr_htc_incredible) came in the mail yesterday and I don&#8217;t think I could be any more excited if [Gad Elmaleh](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/12/14/movie-review-10-weizman-street-plus-comme-ton-pere/) came in the mail (but only if the shipping was free.)

This is not my phone, but [engaget&#8217;s](http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/19/droid-incredible-review/), because, unfortunately, out of all of the things he can do, he can&#8217;t take pictures of himself.  Also, I don&#8217;t wear paisley ties. Mostly.

  Anyway, now that I finally have a smartphone, I can be plugged into the intertubes like I&#8217;m on crack.  It&#8217;s very exciting.  The only thing that&#8217;s not exciting is that he doesn&#8217;t have a name yet, and I need your help.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;ve named inanimate objects since I was very little.  And, apparently, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/topic/san-francisco-do-you-name-your-inanimate-objects-or-appliances">I&#8217;m</a> <a href="http://www.fluther.com/disc/27915/do-you-name-inanimate-objects/">not</a> <a href="http://www.helium.com/items/658015-humor-the-importance-of-naming-inanimate-objects">alone</a>.  I named my parent&#8217;s house Greta when I was in 7th grade, because it just felt right.  She is so sunny and cheery and proper, that she couldn&#8217;t be anything else.  My computer&#8217;s name is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyar">Iyar</a> and my car is Cecilia.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So, I&#8217;m trying to come up with a name for this phone.  I know he is masculine because phones are very rarely feminine.  Even iPhones.  I know that he gets stuff done quickly and quietly and is very powerful.  He is also friendly.  I, on the other hand, am slightly clinically unstable because phones don&#8217;t have human features.  <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/stop-anthropomorphizing-me,11459/">Neither do dogs</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  However, I won&#8217;t apologize for being crazy, because <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/05/16/the-beginning-of-wisdom-is-to-call-things-by-their-right-names/">names</a> are important and this phone needs a name asap, and I need your help. Suggestions?  Also, do you think the people at <a href="http://nameberry.com/">Nameberry</a> would banish me if I started posting about this in the forums?
