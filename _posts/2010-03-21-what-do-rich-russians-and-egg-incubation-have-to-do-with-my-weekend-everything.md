    Mr. B and I went to visit the fam in Philadelphia this weekend, as we often do.  During that time, Mr. B&#8217;s mom told us an amazing story about some of Mr. B&#8217;s second cousins, who are crazy rich in Russia because they made money during the chaos after the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s [<a href="http://scolarite.sciencespobordeaux.fr/IMG/pdf/Gurievoligarchs.pdf">A Quick introduction to how Russians mostly became rich after the fall of the Soviet Union]</a>.  Mr. B&#8217;s mom regaled us with tales of how this family lives, including a play-by-play of their huge mansion near Moscow, the numerous servants that make whatever you want for breakfast, and the fact that they buy iPhones like there&#8217;s no tomorrow.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;That sounds AWESOME,&#8221; I told Mr. B.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;It&#8217;s not that great,&#8221; said Mr. B.  &#8220;They&#8217;re miserable because they&#8217;re so rich.  Money doesn&#8217;t always buy happiness.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I reflected.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I would change if I had money.  I would probably do a couple more bachelor&#8217;s degrees in fun stuff like <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/nejs/">Jewish Studies</a> or <a href="http://www.aub.edu.lb/fas/cames/Pages/index.aspx">Arabic</a> or <a href="http://sfs.georgetown.edu/learning/graduate/">International Relations</a>, then <a href="http://www.roomzaar.com/rate-my-space/Home-Exterior/Sedona-Old-World-Beauty/detail.esi?oid=14016407">buy a house</a>, and then <a href="http://www.thirteenmonths.com/">just travel a lot</a>.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I paused.  &#8220;I would also probably pay lots of dough to clone myself and have half of my brain implanted into the clone and have my original body eat whatever the hell I want, including Nutella, and have the clone body be all fit and use that one as my primary body.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Mr. B was silent for several seconds.  &#8220;So you would let one body go to fat because of Nutella and the other one would be for walking around and stuff?&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; I said.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Would you also be hiring a personal trainer for the clone body?&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;Yes. Of course.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;And you were saying you wouldn&#8217;t let the money go to your head?&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8220;No, not really.&#8221;
  </p>

    It&#8217;s Monday, and that also means it&#8217;s time for a pop quiz.  What?  You&#8217;re not ready?  You should have studied  by being in Philadelphia this weekend while the fam exchanged birthing stories as a tool to cheer up and encourage a family member who is due soon.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Which one of these child birthing stories would make Vicki and Mr. B most likely to want to have a baby:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A.  The hospital gives you an epidural and it doesn&#8217;t work so you have to have  a baby in excruciating pain, including a shot in your back as you are giving birth<br /> B.  Your husband gets to cut the umbilical cord (DO NOT Google this), which is a rite of passage amongst most fathers<br /> C.  You are in labor for almost three days<br /> D.  You are not given any epidural because you give birth to Mr. B  in the Soviet Union (motto: &#8220;Epidural? Anasthesia?  Where do you think you are, a normal country?&#8221;)  and you bite the inside of your cheek so hard that you bleed and  are sore for three days afterward.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you answered E, becoming rich enough to buy a test-tube uterus and having the ova grow there and then be able to pop it out of the jar a la <a href="http://www.huxley.net/bnw/one.html">Brave New World</a>, you win the prize.*
  </p>
  
  <p>
    *this is also an example of money not going to my head
