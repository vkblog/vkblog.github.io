This weekend, my aunt is coming from Russia. I think she&#8217;s bringing lots of blogging fodder in her suitcase (and, I&#8217;m hoping, [dried mushrooms](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/05/18/%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%8B-russian-mushrooms/)).   She lives in [Yaroslavl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaroslavl), which is a pretty small town, and the amount of culture shock she receives in America, even from my family, is insane.

For instance, my mom gets up to go running or biking at 6:00 am on weekends, which my aunt can&#8217;t fathom, because the only people who run outside in Yaroslavl are lunatics.  Also, she can&#8217;t believe that squirrels exist freely in the wild (our backyard) because there are no small animals in Yaroslavl, seeing as to how they have all been killed by alcoholics or chased away by pollution.  Ah, Russia.
