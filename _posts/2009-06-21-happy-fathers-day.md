  This is my dad.   He gave me both my poor vision and my innate Russian sense of melancholy and the feeling that we&#8217;re all going to die soon.  I love him anyway.  He not only painted a whole piano for me (a piano I stopped playing after about a year), he also made me breakfast almost every morning I went to school, reminded me gently to put on a jacket (by telling me he would beat me if I didn&#8217;t), and taught me how to drive, an experience that I&#8217;m sure contributed single-handedly to an increase in blood pressure on his behalf.  I&#8217;m so lucky to have a dad who not only loves me so much, but can cut a mean turkey.  Spasibo, Pap.

  If you also have a Russian father that has raised you by threats of beatings, please tell him how grateful you are that you are now an upstanding, fine citizen.
