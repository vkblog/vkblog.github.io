This post is inspired by the two-and-a-half hour meeting we had at work recently because we are switching healthcare providers.  All was going well, until, at the end, someone finally asked about the cost of monthly premiums. The meeting went something like this:



As I sat, listening to the differences between the options, the copays, the decductibles, the monthly payments, and the sell-your-soul-to-the-devil for Levitra monthly option, I kept wishing I had a little yes-no checkmark box with a picture of the benefits I would actually get from my new health insurance on it.  Because I think explaining these things at a third-grade level would really be the best PPO option for me.
