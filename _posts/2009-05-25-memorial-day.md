I think Memorial Day&#8217;s a great idea in principle.  But the problem with Memorial Day is that it doesn&#8217;t mean anything in the United States, where only [1% or less of the population](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080208105328AAX8gl1) is military veterans. If you are a military family, it means a lot to you.  You are proud of the service and you have your relatives that have served in uniform.  But it&#8217;s really sad that the rest of the population is out shopping and everyone from the radio to the television offer trite platitudes.  It also doesn&#8217;t help that a lot of American forays that have killed a lot of troops (Afghanistan, Iraq, Nicaragua, Somalia, Vietnam&#8230;..) have been due to money interests, not necessarily national defense and what&#8217;s best for America.

As I&#8217;ve heard before, &#8220;The Marines are at war.  America is at the mall.&#8221;

Maybe I&#8217;m just bitter.   Anyway, if you or someone you know have served, my allegorical hat goes off to you.
