  Since <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/11/23/whats-the-deal-with-the-russian-new-year-tree/">last week&#8217;s post </a>on New Year trees, I&#8217;ve put up our own. Since I currently have no post of substance to offer you (I am working on one for this evening/night,) I figure I can distract you with our tree for now.

  If you&#8217;re wondering why a bird is our tree topper, that would be because doves stand for the universal message of peace and love. Also because I was too cheap to buy a star tree topper for $12.99.Â  There is a bit of Jewish in that tree, after all.
