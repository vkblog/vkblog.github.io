It&#8217;s true that comedy writers usually <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/09/16/gods-is-straight-up-messing-with-me/" target="_blank">need to be miserable</a> to produce good content.  Unfortunately, I had a very excellent birthday weekend filled with friends, family, love, happiness, and those little tarts that have fruit on them, so I&#8217;m all out of ideas.

I could blog about my weekend. However, I can&#8217;t, because, according to my family, if you tell people good things that are happening to you, they are going to hate you and mess up your good luck through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_eye" target="_blank">Russian version of the evil eye</a>.  I tried to figure out how this works according to, you know, real-world physics, but apparently they &#8220;can&#8217;t explain,&#8221; and they &#8220;just know if someone is jealous of you it sends bad energy your way.&#8221; For example, they are convinced that our house <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/04/05/did-you-know-that-our-maybe-house-has-evil-spirits-also-heres-a-picture-of-me-eating-bread/" target="_blank">used to have radon</a> because someone doesn&#8217;t like us and found out that we were buying a house. It&#8217;s like schadenfreude, but only more extreme. Everything is more extreme in Russian.  It was very hard to explain to the home inspector.

Which is why I&#8217;m not allowed to tell you that I&#8217;m not not starting a new job that I am very not  unexcited about soon, I can&#8217;t tell you that <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2011/08/02/the-great-news-im-getting-an-ipad-the-terrible-news-im-getting-an-ipad/" target="_blank">I didn&#8217;t not get an iPad</a>, and I can&#8217;t tell you that I didn&#8217;t not have a great birthday weekend.

It&#8217;s a good thing Zuckerberg isn&#8217;t Russian because Facebook would never have taken off.

However, haters, you&#8217;re in luck!  Because tonight is the beginning of <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2010/07/20/tisha-bare-you-serious-youre-fasting-again/" target="_blank">Tisha B&#8217;Av</a>, one of the Jewish holidays I celebrate with any regularity, so I&#8217;ll be suffering from fasting. My goal is to become so skinny over the course of a single day that  the bad energy directed towards me misses me and lands somewhere else.

In fact, I already haven&#8217;t eaten since breakfast in preparation for tonight, and I&#8217;m feeling a little less Rubenesque.

Stay tuned as I try to out-Jew Russian pessimism tomorrow.  Should be a blast!
