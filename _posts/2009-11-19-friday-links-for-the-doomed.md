I am off for the day today from work! I am hoping to have a productive day by catching up on writing the novel.  I have about 15k words to go to finish, so this particular poster above represents how I&#8217;m feeling right now. (in case you can&#8217;t tell, I&#8217;ve been playing around with Photoshop.)

Here are the links for today:
