Yesterday, as Mr. B and I are taking a walk:

Me: So, a Pinkberry just opened in Denver and there are ridiculous lines.
  
Mr. B:  Pinkberry&#8217;s going to be a mainstay in the future.
  
Me:  I think this [whole frozen yogurt thing is a huge fad](http://www.allbusiness.com/franchises/12606122-1.html) and the market is oversaturated, just like it got in the 1980s.
  
Mr. B: (defensively) No it&#8217;s not. Frozen yogurt is here to stay and so is the healthy food movement.
  
\*\*20-minute argument about whether frozen yogurt is a fad or will stay and how it relates to the healthy food movement\*\*
  
Mr. B:  It&#8217;s not a fad. I&#8217;m going to make sure of that.  I&#8217;m going to e-mail everyone I know to eat frozen yogurt. I am going to spam the hell out of my whole mailing list.
  
Me: Ah! The truth comes out.  It&#8217;s not a fad because you don&#8217;t want it to be a fad because you love frozen yogurt. Who are you going to spam, your grandparents?  And then they&#8217;ll go to Pinkberry with their Macs and their hipster glasses?
  
Mr. B: Yes.  And I&#8217;m going to make sure everyone else loves it, too. I&#8217;ll e-mail our family and tell them frozen yogurt supports Israel.  They&#8217;ll eat it.
  
Me: What are you, the kingmaker of desserts?
  
Mr. B: Correct.

This is the man I live with.
