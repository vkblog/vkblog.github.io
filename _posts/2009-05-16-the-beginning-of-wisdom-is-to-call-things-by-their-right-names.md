I was nameless for two weeks after I was born.  My mom and dad hadn&#8217;t decided on a name beforehand, and didn&#8217;t bother to consult the ultrasound.  There was no ultrasound in Russia.  Just, maybe, if the mom&#8217;s stomach was more eliptical than round, it was probably a boy.  And if the doctor sacrificed a sheep under the light of the moon and the entrails leaned to the right, then, most likely a girl.

Anyway, so after I was born there were Intense Party meetings, mostly between my dad, my mom, and my grandma, my mom&#8217;s mom.

&#8220;I want to name her Svetlana.  Or Alisa (Alice),&#8221;  My dad said.

&#8220;No,&#8221; said my grandma.  That was the meeting.

The conflict went on for two weeks and I was just referred to as &#8220;she,&#8221; kind of like Cousin It, but only fatter.

  I was so fatty I couldn&#8217;t sit upright for the first couple months. Part of this fatiness was because in Russia, it was important to keep feeding a child until they couldn&#8217;t take anymore. Because a fat child was a healthy child in a country run on 5-year plans, where food never seemed to actually be in the plans. So the constant feeding was kind of like love waterboarding.  By the time I was 2, I was the size of a baby hippo.  &#8220;She looks so good,&#8221; my grandma, born in WWII and understanding famines, complimented my mom.  My mom beamed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  My dad said, &#8220;What about Victoria?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  My grandma brightened up.  Vika is the Russian nickname for Victoria and she just happened to have a breed of strawberry growing at her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dacha">dacha</a> nicknamed Vika. Also, Vika rhymes with klubnika, which is strawberry in Russian.  It was perfect!  My father scratched his head.  He&#8217;d gotten the name from some novel and remembered it and liked it.  He didn&#8217;t remember which one.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Others in my family were still kind of liking Svetlana, but my dad stuck with Victoria.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Years later, when we immigrated to America, all the Svetlanas, Nadezhdas, and Tatiyanas suffered.  At immigration, they struggled to Latinize their names, which with specific cadence and intonation, just didn&#8217;t fit into English, the way you can&#8217;t just cram a $500 Gucci dress into your cheap $20 suitcase.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I stayed Victoria at first.  But even in first grade, it became too pretentious for me.  While other Russian Viktoria, Viktoriya, and Victoriyas and wore their strange permutations with pride, I was uneasy.  It was too big of a name for me, too majestic, too Soviet for a time when I just tried not to be noticed as the weird kid out in my American school, even though it was still an English name.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Victoria, can you solve this problem?&#8221;  Mrs. Gray called on me.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Can you call me Vicki,&#8221; I said.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  &#8220;Sure, Vickie,&#8221; she said.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But I definitely knew I wasn&#8217;t a Vicky, Vickie, or a Vikki.  I was a Vicki, plain and simple, with the least letters. It was easier that way in English to normalize.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  At home, I was still Vika, Vikachka, Vikanka, Vikushenka, Vikusenka (my dad&#8217;s name for me,) and dochenka (diminutive for daughter.)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But at school, I was Vicki. And as I grew older, I found that I didn&#8217;t want to go back to Victoria.  I&#8217;m still pretty uncomfortable with it.  I don&#8217;t think anyone I know has ever called me Victoria. I keep hoping someday I&#8217;ll grow into it.

    Stay tuned for a second part where I painfully detail how I screwed myself over when I chose my Hebrew name.   Bonus points if you know what it is.
