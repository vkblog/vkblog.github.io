_A fairytale: Me and Mr. B getting approved for a 4% interest rate mortgage and closing on a house.  And living. TOGETHER._ 

Guess what? I finally saw The Princess and the Frog back when men were men, women were women, and my commute was 25 minutes on the Metro.   [I&#8217;ve written about it earlie](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/12/01/disneys-the-princesss-and-the-frog-and-the-economics-of-race/)r but didn&#8217;t have a chance to review.

Let&#8217;s start with a clip from Dr. Facilier, shall we?



I&#8217;m a [Disney kid](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/01/30/crying-unabashedly-during-disney-movies/) and I&#8217;ve [been raised on Disney](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/10/13/russian-letziyon-aladdin-and-jasmine/), so it&#8217;s only natural that I had [high expectations](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/wlb/2009/06/23/the-kids-arent-alright/) and hope for a continuation of the company&#8217;s early 1990s Golden Age.  Even as I was enjoying the movie, I was mentally comparing to other cartoons, and maybe that&#8217;s something I wouldn&#8217;t have done if I were younger.

I love everything about this movie and the people that say it is racist, sexist, Randy Newmanist, and lame can go suck it in the bayou.  Let&#8217;s break down what it teaches:

  * [Women don&#8217;t want to have children](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAVM-vwX8Pk) but want to pursue their dreams of being foodies and don&#8217;t need the help of men to get there.
  * Family values.
  * [How beautiful New Orleans and jazz and Southern culture is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBhO_T6mvco), without patronizing it, introducing it to a whole new generation.
  * [Hot men with vague European accents that love you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfeK2FIRxRo) no matter how you look are compatible with feminism! (spoiler for the end of the movie, [also spoiler for this blog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/wlb/gh-pages/assets/images/2010/09/Page_14.jpg)) Also, women can build stuff!
  * Voodoo culture. So much so that it piqued my curiosity and I spent the whole evening reading about voodoo. Unfortunately, this ancient and mysterious practice has nothing of interest for Jews who would like to conjure up currency.
  * Awesome characters, including a jazz-playing alligator. LOTS OF TEACHABLE MOMENTS. And I don&#8217;t mean for little kids. I mean for me. I had to google Charlie Parker after seeing this movie.

Anyway, I thought this movie was awesome. Not like Beauty and the Beast awesome, but a solid 7.  I am relistening to all the music as we speak.
