  This inserts the "about" photo and text from `_config.yml`.
  You can edit it there (jekyll needs restart!) or remove it and provide your own photo/text.
  Don't forget to add the `me` class to the photo, like this: `![alt](src){:.me}`.

I&#8217;m Vicki.  I used to be [a nerd](http://www.amazon.com/Theres-Something-about-Scotland-Boykis-ebook/dp/B007TQ8370), then I moved to the Philly suburbs and had a baby. Now I'm even lamer.   
  
I was born in Russia. I didn&#8217;t have a first name for a month, then I  was named after a breed of strawberry growing on my grandmother&#8217;s dacha in Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia. My full name is Victoria but I hate being called that because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever grow into it.


 When I was five, my parents decided that Russia was unhealthy for human beings and hightailed it to America.

Growing up, I knew 2.5 other Russian Jews and no one was writing about our experiences. I also didn&#8217;t know anyone else that was as weird as me. So, sometimes I write about being Russian and Jewish. But sometimes I write about feminism, careers, tech, Nutella, running, my daughter, my husband, Mr. B, or what I did yesterday.

Before Philly, we used to live in and love Washington, D.C. Before that, Mr. B proposed to me in a synagogue in the city of Prague, which I hated. (Prague, not the synagogue or the proposal.)

In real life, I work in [tech](http://veekaybee.github.io/). I also just finished my MBA!
